<h2>THE LITERATURE<br />

OF<br />
OLD TESTAMENT<br />
</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE CANON OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h3>


<p>The early Christians received the Sacred Books
of the Jews as inspired Scripture containing a
divine revelation and clothed with divine
authority, and till well on in the first century
of the Christian era the name Scriptures was
applied exclusively to these books. In time,
as they came to attach the same authority
to the Epistles and Gospels, and to call them,
too, Scriptures (2 Pet. iii. 16), they distinguished
the Christian writings as the Scriptures
of the new dispensation, or, as they called it,
the "new covenant," from the Scriptures of
the "old covenant" (2 Cor. iii. 6, 14), the
Bible of the Jews. The Greek word for
covenant (<i>diathéké</i>) was rendered in the early
Latin translation by <i>testamentum</i>, and the
two bodies of Scripture themselves were called
the Old Testament and the New Testament
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The Scriptures of the Jews were written in
Hebrew, the older language of the people;
but a few chapters in Ezra and Daniel are in
Aramaic, which gradually replaced Hebrew
as the vernacular of Palestine from the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small> The Sacred Books comprise
the Law, that is, the Five Books of Moses;
the Prophets, under which name are included
the older historical books (Joshua, Judges,
Samuel, Kings) as well as what we call the
Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the
Twelve, i.e. Minor Prophets); a third group,
of less homogeneous character, had no more
distinctive name than the "Scriptures"; it
included Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel,
Esther, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles.
The Minor Prophets counted as one book;
and the division of Samuel, Kings, Ezra-Nehemiah,
and Chronicles each into two books
was made later, and perhaps only in Christian
copies of the Bible. There are, consequently,
according to the Jewish enumeration twenty-four
books in the Bible, while in the English
Old Testament, by subdivision, we count the
same books as thirty-nine.</p>

<p>The order of the books in the Pentateuch
and "Former Prophets" (Joshua-Kings) is
fixed by the historical sequence, and therefore
constant; among the "Latter Prophets"
Jeremiah was sometimes put first, immediately
following the end of Kings, with which it was
so closely connected. In the third group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
there was no such obvious principle of arrangement,
and consequently there were different
opinions about the proper order; that which
is given above follows the oldest deliverance
on the subject, and puts them in what the
rabbis doubtless supposed to be a chronological
series. So long as the books were written on
separate rolls of papyrus, the question of
order was theoretical rather than practical;
and even when manuscripts were written in
codex form (on folded leaves stitched together
like our books), no uniformity was attained.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Christian era, lessons
from the Law were regularly read in the
synagogues on the sabbath (the Pentateuch
being so divided that it was read through
consecutively once in three years), and a second
lesson was chosen from the Prophets. The
title of these books to be regarded as Sacred
Scripture was thus established by long-standing
liturgical use, and was, indeed,
beyond question. Nor was there any question
about the inspiration of most of the books
in the third group, the "Scriptures." There
was a controversy, however, over Ecclesiastes
and the Song of Songs; some teachers of the
strictest school denied that either of them was
inspired, while others accepted only one of
them. The question was voted on in a
council of rabbis held at Jamnia about the
beginning of the second century of our era,
and the majority decided for the inspiration
of both books. There were also, even down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the third century, Jewish scholars who did
not acknowledge Esther as Sacred Scripture.
On the other hand, some were inclined to
include among the Sacred Books the Proverbs
of Ben Sira, which stand in the English Bible
among the Apocrypha under the title Ecclesiasticus.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that, while there was
agreement in general, there was, down to the
second century <small>A.D.</small>, no authoritative list of
the "Scriptures," and that about some of the
books there were conflicting opinions among
the learned of the most orthodox stamp.
An interesting confirmation of this is the fact
that in the first half of that century it was
thought necessary to make a formal deliverance
that the "Gospel and other writings of
the heretics" are not Sacred Scripture. There
are other indications that in that generation
Jewish Christianity had a dangerous
attraction for some even in rabbinical circles,
and there was evidently ground for apprehension
that the inspiration which the
Christians claimed for the Scriptures of the
New Covenant might impose upon well-meaning
but uninstructed Jews. In the same
connection it was decided, further, that Ben
Sira (Ecclesiasticus) was not Holy Scripture,
and that no books written from his time on
(about 200 <small>B.C.</small>) were inspired, in accordance
with the theory, found also in Josephus, that
inspiration ceased in the age of Ezra and
Nehemiah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>By such decisions, recognizing the inspiration
of books that had been challenged and
excluding others for which inspiration had
been claimed, the canon of the Scriptures,
that is, the authoritative list of Sacred Books,
was defined. The oldest catalogue we have,
containing the titles of all the books, dates
probably from the latter part of the second
century, and is not concerned with the point of
canonicity&mdash;which it takes for granted&mdash;but
with the proper order of the Prophets and the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>The Jews had for centuries been widely
distributed through the lands that had been
included in the kingdoms of Alexander's
successors. There were large numbers in
Babylonia and the neighbouring provinces of
the Parthian empire, and still more in the
countries around the eastern end of the
Mediterranean, in Syria and Asia Minor, in
Egypt and Cyrene. In Alexandria the Jews
had a whole quarter of the city to themselves,
and Philo estimates their numbers in Egypt
in his time (ca. <small>A.D.</small> 40) at a million.</p>

<p>In cities like Alexandria, where Greek was
the common speech of a population recruited
from many races, the Jews soon exchanged
their mother tongue for the cosmopolitan
language. The ancient Hebrew of their Sacred
Books was unintelligible, not only to the
masses, but even to most of the educated,
who had learned in the schools of Greek
rhetoricians and philosophers rather than at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the feet of the rabbis. If the knowledge
of the holy Law by which the distinctive
Jewish life was regulated was not to be lost
altogether, the Scriptures must be translated
into Greek. The Pentateuch was doubtless
translated first&mdash;legend attributes the initiative
to King Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-246
<small>B.C.</small>); then other books, by different hands
and at different times and places. To some
of the books, as to Daniel and Esther, additions
were made in the translation which were not
accepted by the Palestinian Jews.</p>

<p>Besides the books which were finally
included in the Jewish canon, there were
various others, written in Hebrew or Aramaic
after the pattern of the several forms of Biblical
literature. History, for example, is
represented by 1 Maccabees, relating the
struggle of the Jews in Palestine for religious
liberty and national independence in the
second century <small>B.C.</small>; the Proverbs of Solomon
have a counterpart in the Proverbs of Ben
Sira, already mentioned; the Psalter, in the
so-called Psalms of Solomon; the story of
Judith may be compared with Esther; the
visions of Daniel have their parallel in popular
apocalypses bearing the names of Enoch,
Noah, Ezra, Baruch, and other ancient
worthies. These writings were sooner or later
translated into Greek, and some of them
attained a wide circulation. The Greek-speaking
Jews, also, produced a religious
literature, in part imitating the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Biblical forms, as in the Wisdom of Solomon
and 2 Maccabees, in part cast in Greek moulds,
as when prophecy disguised itself in Sibylline
Oracles, or the supremacy of reason over the
emotions was made the subject of a discourse
after the pattern of a Stoic diatribe (4 Maccabees).</p>

<p>The influence of Greek culture on many of
these writers was not confined to language
and literary form; they lived in an atmosphere
of Greek thought&mdash;the popular philosophy,
in which Platonic and Stoic elements
were fused or confused&mdash;and a few had a
more academic acquaintance with the Greek
thinkers. But, under all this, they were Jews
to the core, devoted to the religion of their
fathers, of the superiority of which they were
the more convinced by the spectacle of
heathenism about them: Judaism was the
only true religion, its Scriptures the one
divine revelation. The Law and the Prophets
had the same precedence as in the Palestinian
synagogue. Of the other Scriptures there
was no authoritative and exclusive list, and
among books read solely for private edification
it is not likely that a very sharp line was
drawn; but, on the whole, the practice of the
Greek-speaking Jews does not seem to have
been materially different from that of their
countrymen in Palestine.</p>

<p>Outside of Palestine, Christianity was
spread by Greek-speaking Jews who had
embraced the new Messianic faith, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
converts in the fields of their missionary
labours, both Jews and Gentiles, spoke Greek,
either as their mother tongue or as the language
of common intercourse. The church,
therefore, took over the Jewish Scriptures
in the existing translations: the Christian
Old Testament was from the beginning the
Greek Bible, not the Hebrew. They received
also from the Greek-speaking Jews the belief
in the divine inspiration of the translators,
by virtue of which the same infallible authority
attached to the version of the Seventy which
belonged to the Hebrew original. In their
desire to possess every word of God, they
gathered up the religious books which they
found in the hands of the Jews, without inquiring
curiously whether the Jews included
them in the narrower category of Sacred
Scriptures or not; and they discovered no
reason in the books themselves why Esther,
for example, should be inspired and Judith
not; or why Ecclesiastes, with its scepticism
about the destiny of the soul, should be
divinely revealed, and the Wisdom of Solomon,
with its eloquent defence of immortality,
a purely human production; or, again, why
the Proverbs of Solomon were Scripture,
and the Proverbs of Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus)
nothing but profane wisdom.</p>

<p>Controversies in the second century made
the Christian apologists aware that the Jews
did not acknowledge the authority of some
of the books from which their opponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
adduced proof-texts, and this practical concern,
rather than purely learned interest,
led to the drawing up of lists of books which
were accepted by the Jews as Sacred Scripture.
The oldest of these lists which has
come down to us was made by Melito, Bishop
of Sardes, about <small>A.D.</small> 170; it contains the
books of the Jewish canon enumerated above
(p. 8), with the noteworthy exception of Esther,
about which, as we have seen, Jewish opinion
was divided. Christian catalogues of the
Jewish Old Testament long show an uncertainty
about the right of this book to a place
in the canon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the church had, in its worship
and in religious instruction, established a
use and tradition of its own. The Wisdom of
Jesus, son of Sirach, was appropriated for the
moral instruction of youth and of converts,
as is shown by the title it bears in the Greek
Bible, Ecclesiasticus, that is, "The Church
Book," and other writings not included in the
Jewish canon were highly esteemed in the
church. About <small>A.D.</small> 240, Julius Africanus,
Bishop of Emmaus in Palestine, addressed
a critical letter to Origen on the story of
Susanna and the Elders in the Book of Daniel.
This story, he said, was not found in the
Hebrew Daniel, and was not acknowledged by
the Jews. He proved by internal evidence
that it was not translated from the Hebrew,
the language in which the Scriptures of the Old
Testament were inspired, but originally composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in Greek, and he raised various historical
objections to the tale: it ought not, therefore,
to be quoted as Sacred Scripture. In his
answer, Origen, the greatest Biblical scholar
of his age, argued that if the story of Susanna
was to be set aside on the ground that it was
not accepted by the Jews, other books, such
as Judith and Tobit, would have to be
rejected also. He appeals to the prescriptive
usage of the church itself, which had always
used these books and read them with edification.
This immemorial tradition was authority
enough for Christians; there was no
reason why the church should prune its
Bible to please the Jews or adapt itself to their
opinions about what was and what was not
inspired Scripture; he reminds his correspondent
of the law, "Thou shalt not remove
the ancient landmarks which those before
thee have set."</p>

<p>This way of looking at the matter, as might
be expected, prevailed in the church. Lists
of the books of the Jewish Bible were handed
down, and scholars were well aware that the
Christian Old Testament contained several
books not received by the Jews. By the more
critical of the Greek Fathers these books are
not cited with the same authority for the
establishment of doctrine as the books of the
Hebrew Bible. Thus, Athanasius, at the end
of a list of the canonical Scriptures of the Old
and New Testaments (<small>A.D.</small> 365), adds: "There
are, besides these, other books, not, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
included in the canon, but prescribed by the
Fathers to be read by those who come to the
church and wish to be taught the doctrine of
religion, namely, the Wisdom of Solomon,
and the Wisdom of Sirach, Esther, Judith,
Tobit, and the Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles." But this learned reserve had no
effect on the liturgical or practical use of the
church. The question of the inspiration and
authority of the supernumerary books of the
Old Testament was not decided by any council
speaking in the name of the catholic church;
nor was it ever thus determined exactly what
these supernumerary books were, though
several local synods made lists of them.</p>

<p>The Latin Church received its Bible from the
Greeks, and the Latin translations of the Old
Testament made from the Greek included, as
a matter of course, the books which the church
accepted and the synagogue rejected. About
the beginning of the fifth century, Jerome
undertook a new Latin translation direct
from the Hebrew. He lived for many years
at Bethlehem, and had learned Hebrew from
Jewish teachers, whose assistance he employed
also in the work of translation. In some of
the prefaces to this translation (which was
published in parts), and in other places in his
writings, Jerome gives a catalogue of the books
of the Hebrew Bible, corresponding to the
contents of our English Old Testament, and
expressly excludes all others from the class of
canonical Scriptures: "Whatever is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
included in this list is to be classed as apocrypha.
Therefore Wisdom (commonly entitled
'of Solomon'), and the Book of Jesus son of
Sirach, and Judith and Tobit ... are
not in the canon." The word "apocrypha,"
literally "secret, or esoteric, writings," had
been used generally for the books of heretical
sects, or suspected of being such, and, more
broadly, of writings which the church repudiated
as not only uninspired but harmful, the
reading of which it often forbade. It was,
therefore, a very radical word that Jerome
uttered when he applied this name to books
which the church had always regarded as
godly and edifying.</p>

<p>Jerome himself did not consistently maintain
the position which would make the Jewish
Bible the canon of the Christian church. At
the request of certain bishops he translated
Judith and Tobit, noting in the prefaces that
the Jews exclude these books from the canon
and put them among the apocrypha, but
significantly adding in the one case that he
thinks it better to oppose the judgment of the
Pharisees and obey the commands of the
bishops, in the other pleading not only the
demand of a bishop but the fact that the
Nicene Council had included Judith among
the Sacred Books.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In another preface he
describes Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Solomon as books which the church reads
"for the edification of the people, not for
proving the doctrines of the church"&mdash;a
definition which accords with the attitude of
many of the Greek Fathers. Jerome thus
halts between two opinions: in relegating to
the apocrypha everything that is not in the
Hebrew Bible he speaks as a critic; in recognizing
the books found in the Christian Old
Testament, but not in the Hebrew, as useful
and edifying, though of inferior authority for
doctrinal purposes, he, like Origen, takes the
ground of the practical churchman. The
mediating position is more clearly defined by
Rufinus, who, after giving a catalogue of the
books of the Hebrew Bible, adds: "There are
other books, which older authors called not
'canonical' but 'ecclesiastical,' such as the
Wisdom of Solomon, and the so-called Wisdom
of the Son of Sirach, named by the Latins
Ecclesiasticus; to the same class belong Tobit,
Judith and the Books of the Maccabees."</p>

<p>The great influence of Augustine was thrown
wholly on the side of ecclesiastical tradition;
he even remonstrated with Jerome for translating
the Old Testament from the Hebrew
and thus disturbing the minds of the faithful,
instead of revising the Old Latin version after
the Greek. In his treatise on Christian
Doctrine (ii. 8; written in <small>A.D.</small> 397) he includes
among the canonical books of the Old Testament,
Judith, Tobit, 1 and 2 Maccabees,
Ecclesiasticus, and the Wisdom of Solomon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
African provincial synods at Hippo (<small>A.D.</small> 393)
and Carthage (<small>A.D.</small> 397) pronounced themselves
in the same sense.</p>

<p>The Syriac-speaking churches, whose Old
Testament was translated from the Hebrew,
originally recognized those books only which
were found in the Jewish Bible; it appears,
indeed, that the earliest Syriac version did not
extend to Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah,
but did include Sirach. Under the influence of
the Greek Church, those branches of the Syrian
Church which remained in communion with it
gradually added to their Bible translations of
the other books from the Greek; but the
Nestorians, in whose schools Biblical criticism
moved more freely than in the Catholic
Church, continued to reject them, or to accord
them, together with several of the books
commonly reckoned canonical (Chronicles,
Ezra, Nehemiah, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees,
Job, Ecclesiasticus, Wisdom), only qualified
authority.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages learned authors
repeated the conflicting utterances of the
Fathers concerning the canon, without being
disturbed by their inconsistency; in practice,
the Old Testament comprised all the books
that were usually found in copies of the Greek
or Latin Bible, without regard to the fine
distinctions of "canonical" and "ecclesiastical."
The immemorial usage of the church
had more weight than the opinions of scholars.
With this concurred the fact that from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fourth century on the Bible was copied in
collective codices, on folded sheets of parchment
or vellum like our books, not in separate
rolls, and thus the canon of the Old Testament
became, not a mere list of Sacred Books, but
a physical unity, in which the books of the
Jewish Bible were intermingled with those
which the Jews did not accept.</p>

<p>The question assumed a new significance at
the Reformation. In rejecting the authority
of ecclesiastical tradition and the prescriptive
usage of the church and making the Scriptures
the only rule of faith and practice, the
Reformers were under the necessity of deciding
what books were inspired Scripture, containing
the Word of God revealed to men, clothed with
divine authority, demanding unqualified faith,
and a means of grace to believers. Obviously
they could not logically acknowledge books
whose place in the Bible had no other warrant
than that the church had accepted them
from very early times; nothing short of the
authority of the New Testament itself would
suffice, and they found in the New Testament
no quotations from these books. To the
Jews, St. Paul said, were committed the oracles
of God; it was the Jewish Scriptures to which
Jesus and the Apostles appealed.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, Luther reverted to the
position of Jerome: the books found in the
Hebrew Bible, and those only, were the
Scriptures of the Old Testament; whatever
was more than these was to be reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
among the apocrypha. In the first complete
printed edition of his translation (1534), these
books (Judith, Wisdom, Tobit, Sirach, Baruch,
1 and 2 Maccabees, the Greek additions to
Esther and Daniel, the Prayer of Manasseh)
stand between the Old Testament and the
New, with the title (after Jerome) "<i>Apocrypha</i>;
that is, books that are not equally
esteemed with the Holy Scripture, but nevertheless
are profitable and good to read."
The other Protestant versions, on the Continent
and in England, followed this example.</p>

<p>The attitude of Luther toward the Old
Testament Apocrypha was maintained by the
Lutheran Churches, whose Confessions do
not, however, attempt a more exact definition
of the value and authority of the Apocrypha.
The earlier Reformed (Calvinistic) Confessions
take substantially the same ground: the
Ecclesiastical Books, or Apocrypha, are useful,
especially for moral instruction, but they have
not the same authority as the canonical
books, and doctrines may not be deduced from
them alone. The Articles of the Church of
England (1563; English translation, 1571)
agree on this point with the other Reformed
Confessions: after enumerating the canonical
books "of whose authority there was never
any doubt in the Church," the Sixth Article
continues: "And the other books (as Hierome
saith) the Church doth read for example of
life, and instruction of manners; but yet it
doth not apply them to establish any doctrine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
A list of such books follows, comprising those
commonly printed in the English Bible under
the title Apocrypha.</p>

<p>A more radical position was represented by
the Synod of Dort (1618) and by the Westminster
Assembly (1643). The latter declares:
"The books commonly called Apocrypha, not
being of divine inspiration, are no part of the
canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no
authority in the church of God, nor to be
otherwise approved, or made use of, than
other human writings."</p>

<p>In opposition to the Protestant limitation of
the canon of the Old Testament to the books of
the Hebrew Bible, the Roman Church defined
its attitude more sharply. In the Fourth Session
of the Council of Trent (1546) it framed a
"Decree concerning the Canonical Scripture,"
in which the books set apart by the Protestants
as Apocrypha are included with the rest.
The complete contents of the Old Testament
in the Catholic Bible as thus defined are as
follows: The Five Books of Moses, that is,
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;
Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four Books
of Kings [Samuel, Kings], two Books of
Chronicles, 1 and 2 Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah],
Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job, the Psalter of
David, containing one hundred and fifty
Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs,
Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah with
Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel, the Twelve Minor
Prophets, two Books of Maccabees, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the First and Second.... "If any man
does not accept as sacred and canonical these
books, entire, with all their parts, as they
have customarily been read in the Catholic
Church and are contained in the ancient
common Latin edition ... let him be
anathema!"</p>

<p>This decree not only affirms that all the
books in question are Holy and Canonical
Scripture, but seems to put them all in
one class, and deliberately to exclude the
ancient distinction between the books of the
Jewish Bible and the Ecclesiastical Books.
Many of the Fathers had, however, made such
a distinction, and Catholic scholars, even
after Trent, thought it permissible to class
the Ecclesiastical Books (which Protestants
call the Apocrypha) as "deuterocanonic,"
meaning not thereby to imply that they are
inferior in authority or infallibility or dignity&mdash;for
both classes owe their excellence to the
same Holy Spirit&mdash;but that they had attained
recognition in the church at a later time than
the others. Individuals have sometimes gone
farther, and acknowledged a difference in
authority: the deuterocanonic books are
useful for edification, but not for the proof of
doctrines&mdash;a position substantially the same
as that of the Greek Fathers and of moderate
Protestants; but this is plainly against the
sense of the decree of Trent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE OLD TESTAMENT AS A NATIONAL
LITERATURE</h3>


<p>For the religious apprehension of Jews and
Christians the Old Testament is a body of
Sacred Scriptures, containing the Word of
God as revealed to the chosen people. The
revelation was made "at sundry times and
in divers manners" through many centuries,
that is to say, it has a historical character,
an adaptation to the needs or accommodation
to the capacities of men, and, from the
Christian point of view, makes a progressive
disclosure of the divine purpose and plan of
salvation. To understand this economy of
revelation, or this pedagogic of religion, it is
necessary to distinguish the times, and to
determine the nature, authorship, and age
of the several books or parts of books. The
critical questions which lie at the threshold
of every historical inquiry arise, therefore,
in the study of the Old Testament, and much
learning and acumen have been expended
upon them, especially in modern times,
by scholars of all shades of theological opinion.
That there should be wide divergence in their
conclusions on many points is not surprising,
in view of the difficulty of many of the
questions and the insufficiency of the data<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
available for a solution; the same thing is
true in other ancient literatures.</p>

<p>A more radical difference exists in the
Old Testament, however, because, for many
scholars, Catholic and Protestant, the deliverances
of the church, or the consent of tradition,
or the testimony of the New Testament,
or the concurrence of all these, outweighs, in
such a matter as the unity and Mosaic
authorship of the Pentateuch, the internal
evidence of the books themselves, and makes
it their task to show that the evidence which
seems to contradict this attribution is, when
properly interpreted, compatible with it;
while others hold that no external authority
and no theory of inspiration can be allowed
to countervail the cumulative weight of
internal evidence.</p>

<p>Apart from its religious value and authority
for the synagogue and the church, the
Old Testament contains the remains of a
national literature which richly rewards study
for its own sake. While its masterpieces may
be read with pleasure and profit without
regard to the age and circumstances in which
they were written, they will be better appreciated
as well as better understood in the
light of their own times and in their place in
the literature as a whole. In this literature
are also the sources for the political history
of the Hebrew people and for the history of
its civilization and religion. The critical
ordering and appraisal of these sources is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fundamental to any solid historical construction
and, indeed, to any historical understanding
of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>In the present volume the results of this
critical inquiry are concisely set forth, with
primary reference to the history of the literature
and the development of religion, rather
than to the sources for the political history, a
complete investigation of which would require
a somewhat different method. The questions
are approached in the same way in which we
should deal with similar questions in any other
literature; critical problems, whether in
sacred texts or profane, can be solved only by
the application of the established methods of
historical criticism.</p>

<p>All that survives of Hebrew literature
prior to the age of Alexander is preserved in
the Jewish Bible. It is not until the beginning
of the third century <small>B.C.</small> that we come upon
books written by Jews in Hebrew or in Greek
which are not included in the canon. It is,
doubtless, only a small part of a rich and
varied literature that has thus been rescued
across the centuries; much the larger part
of what was written in the days of the national
kingdoms, for example, must have perished
in the catastrophes which befell Israel in
the eighth century and Judah in the beginning of
the sixth. What was saved was preserved for
its intrinsic religious value or its association
with great names of religious leaders and
teachers, not out of a merely literary or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
patriotic interest. Nor were these losses
confined to the older literature. Of the
history of Judah under the Persian kings, for
example, there must once have been completer
records than the dubious scraps we have
in Ezra. Of secular poetry, which there is
every reason to think flourished no less than
hymnody, we should have had no specimens,
had not an anthology of love songs somehow
got the name of Solomon, and by a mystical
interpretation been converted to religion.
The remains of this literature are scattered
unequally over a period of a thousand years or
more. The youngest writings in the canon
date from the second century B.C. (Daniel,
Maccabean Psalms), being later than Sirach,
and contemporary with some of the visions
of Enoch. All that is preserved of the earliest
writings has been transmitted to us by later
authors, who incorporated in their works
longer or shorter passages extracted from their
predecessors.</p>

<p>The books of the Old Testament differ
widely in matter and form&mdash;history and story;
legislation, civil and ritual, moral and ceremonial;
prophecy and apocalypse; lyric,
didactic, and dramatic poetry. The literary
quality of the best in all these kinds is very
high. The Song of Deborah (Judg. 5), notwithstanding
the imperfect state of the text,
is one of the greatest of triumphal odes; parts
of Job attain the height of the sublime;
some of the Psalms are worthy of a foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
place among religious lyrics; many oracles of
the prophets are as noteworthy for the perfection
of the expression as for the elevation of
the thought; the laws are often formulated
with admirable precision; in the art of narration
the older historians are unsurpassed in
ancient literature. These qualities appear
even more conspicuous in comparison with
the remains of Egyptian or of Babylonian
and Assyrian writings. It is only among the
Greeks that we find anything to match the
finest productions of the Hebrew genius. It
need hardly be said that the Old Testament is
not all on this high level of excellence&mdash;what
literature is? But, taken as a whole, the
level is surprisingly high, and even in the
decadence classical models are sometimes
imitated with no small degree of success.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE PENTATEUCH</h3>


<p>The Old Testament begins with a comprehensive
historical work, reaching from the
creation of the world to the fall of the kingdom
of Judah (586 <small>B.C.</small>), which in the Hebrew Bible
is divided into nine books (Genesis-Kings).
The Jews made a greater division at the end
of the fifth book (Deuteronomy) and treated
the first five books (the Pentateuch) as a unit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with a character and name of its own, the
Law. The names of the several books in our
Bibles are derived from the Greek version,
and indicate in a general way the subject
of the book, or, more exactly, the subject
with which it begins: Genesis, the creation
of the world; Exodus, the escape from
Egypt; Leviticus, the priests' book; Numbers,
the census of the tribes; Deuteronomy,
the second legislation, or the recapitulation
of the law.</p>

<p>The three middle books of the Pentateuch
(Exodus-Numbers) are more closely connected
with one another than with the preceding and
following books (Genesis, Deuteronomy);
in fact, they form a whole which is only for
convenience in handling divided into parts.
In these books narrative and legislation are
somewhat unequally represented. Exod. 1-19
is almost all narrative, as are also c. 24, and
cc. 32-34; the story is picked up again in
Num. 10, what lies between is wholly legislative;
in Num. 10-27, 28-36, narrative and
laws alternate, the latter predominating. It
is evident that from the author's point of
view the narrative was primarily a historical
setting for the Mosaic legislation.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy begins with a brief retrospect
(Deut. 1-3) of the movements of the Israelites
from the time they left the Mount of God till
they arrived in the Plains of Moab, the lifetime
of a whole generation. There, as they are
about to cross the Jordan to possess the Land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of Promise, Moses delivers to them the law
which they shall observe in the land, and with
many exhortations and warnings urges them
to be faithful to their religion with its distinctive
worship and morals. Thus Deuteronomy
also presents itself essentially as legislation.</p>

<p>The history of the Israelite tribes opens
with the account of the oppression in Egypt,
the introduction to the story of deliverance.
Its antecedents are found in the Book of
Genesis, the migration of Jacob and his sons
from Palestine to Egypt several generations
earlier in a time of famine; and this in turn
is but the last chapter in the patriarchal story
which begins with the migration of Abraham
from Syria or Babylonia to Palestine. Gen.
1-11 tells of creation and first men; the great
flood; the dispersion of the peoples, with a
genealogical table showing the affinities of
the several races and another tracing the
descent of Abraham in direct line from Shem
the son of Noah. But even in Genesis the
interest in the law manifests itself in various
ways, such as the sanction of the sabbath,
the prohibition of blood, and the introduction
of circumcision.</p>

<p>In regarding the whole Pentateuch as Law,
or, to express it more accurately, as a revelation
of the principles and observances of
religion, the Jews were, therefore, doing no
violence to the character and spirit of these
books; and in ascribing them to Moses they
were only extending to the whole the authorship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which is asserted in particular of many of
the laws, and especially of the impressive
exhortations in Deuteronomy which form the
climactic close of his work as a legislator.</p>

<p>It was early observed, however, that there
are numerous expressions in the Pentateuch
which assume the settlement of Israel in
Canaan and look back to the age of Moses as
to a somewhat remote past: Gen. xxxvi. 31,
for example, implies the existence of the
Israelite monarchy. In the seventeenth century
such anachronisms were bandied about
a good deal, but, inasmuch as they were all
brief clauses which might well be notes or
glosses by scribes, they proved nothing about
the age of the main text. The controversy
sharpened the eyes of the critics, and many
more conclusive facts were brought to light,
which proved that the Pentateuch was not
the product of one author nor of one age,
and that, whatever part Moses may be
conceived to have had in it, much must be
ascribed to later writers. No methodical
attempt had been made, however, to distinguish
its different strata, or to discover the
sources from which it was compiled. This
was first undertaken by an eminent French
physician, Jean Astruc, who in 1753 published
the results of his investigations under the
modest title "Conjectures concerning the
Original Memoirs which it appears that Moses
used in compiling the Book of Genesis."
Astruc's analysis was suggested by peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
phenomena in the use of the divine names in
Genesis, and he was led to the hypothesis that
Moses had for the primeval and patriarchal
history two principal sources, one of which
employed consistently the proper name Jehovah,
the other the appellative Elohim (God).
The two narratives were in large part parallel,
and when they were united in one continuous
narrative, repetitions, contradictions, and
chronological difficulties were created which
disappear when the sources are separated and
recombined in their original sequence.</p>

<p>This is not the place for a history of criticism:
it must suffice to say that, as the result of the
labours of many scholars in the last century
and a half upon the problem of the sources and
composition of the Pentateuch, historians are
now generally agreed that four main sources
are to be recognized, of which three run, in
varying proportion, from Genesis to Numbers
and reappear in Joshua, while the fourth is
found in Deuteronomy and Joshua only.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CHARACTER OF THE SOURCES: GENESIS</h3>


<p>Of the four main sources of the Pentateuch
and Joshua, two are easily recognizable, and
may be distinguished with certainty in almost
any combination. The Book of Deuteronomy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
though itself a composite work, constitutes a
whole, with a characteristic religious point of
view and marked peculiarities of language and
style. The strand akin to it in Joshua is not
always so easy to discriminate from additions
and editorial retouchings in one of the other
sources; but since these are of approximately
the same age, the difficulty is, from the
historian's point of view, not of very serious
moment.</p>

<p>The second source, more closely interwoven
in the narrative of Genesis-Numbers, and
Joshua, has also such strongly marked peculiarities,
not only in religious ideas and in
phraseology and style, but in its whole conception
and treatment of the history, that it
stands out in salient contrast to any surroundings
in which it may occur. Its interest
is concentrated on the origin of the sacred
institutions of Israel, especially on the priesthood,
the worship, and the distinctive religious
customs of the people, for which reason it is
commonly called the "priestly" history and
law.</p>

<p>The two remaining sources resemble each
other much more closely in religious conceptions,
in language, and in their representation
of the history, so that, where their closely
parallel narratives are intimately interwoven
to make one continuous and harmonious story,
it is often impossible to unravel them. As far
as Exod. iii. 14 one of them employs the name
Elohim for God, while the other uses Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
from the beginning (see Gen. iv. 26), and this
difference frequently serves as a first clue;
but editors and copyists have so often, purposely
or thoughtlessly, interchanged the
names of God that it is by no means a decisive
criterion. From Exod. 3 on, this criterion
fails altogether. Closer acquaintance with
the two sources discovers, under all their
similarity, individual peculiarities by which
they can ordinarily be recognized. Frequently,
also, the connection of the story itself,
references or allusions to incidents already
recounted and preparation for events subsequently
to be narrated, serve to identify
passages with one or the other.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity, it is customary to
designate these sources by symbols: J
(Jahvist), the source in which God is from
the beginning called Jehovah (more exactly,
Jahveh); E (Elohist), the closely cognate
source in which Elohim (God) is consistently
used throughout Genesis; D, Deuteronomy
and the kindred narrative in Joshua; P
(Priestly), the source in which the interest
in the religious institutions predominates.
This author also uses Elohim exclusively in
Genesis, and down to Exod. vi. 2 ff.</p>

<p>The two sources, J and E, both narrate the
story of the patriarchs at some length. J
begins with the migration of Abraham from
Haran (Gen. 12); the corresponding introduction
of Abraham in E is not preserved,
and the first passage that can with confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be attributed to that source is Gen. 20. From
that point through Genesis and down to
Exod. 24, J and E furnished the author of the
Pentateuch most of his narrative. The contents
of both were evidently drawn from the
same common stock of legend, and they tell in
large part the same stories in variant forms,
with differences of incident or of localization.
Sometimes one is ampler and more detailed,
sometimes the other. The author of Genesis
in such cases often chose the fuller version,
enriching it here and there from the other;
in other places the two are combined in more
equal measure into one continuous narrative;
or, again, as in parts of the story of Joseph,
extracts from the two alternate in large blocks.</p>

<p>J and E are, as has been said above, much
alike in language and style, yet each has distinguishing
peculiarities of expression. These of
necessity disappear in a translation, especially
in a translation which, like the Authorized
Version, raises everything to one stately level
of noble English prose. Even in translation,
however, a difference in the story-teller's art
and manner may be discerned. For J the
reader will find good examples in Gen. 18-19;
24; 38; 39; and 43-44 (which are nearly
solid extracts from that source); with the
latter chapters, from the story of Joseph,
should be compared Gen. 40-42, chiefly from
E. Gen. 22 is also from E. From the
literary point of view, J is the better narrator;
he tells his story directly, swiftly, with almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
epic breadth, and with just that measure of
detail which gives the note of reality, never
overloading the story with circumstance.
Nor is it only the external action which he
causes thus vividly to pass before us; with the
dramatic instinct of the true story-teller he
makes us spectators of the inner play of
feeling and motive.</p>

<p>The religious element in the stories of J is
pervasive. The forefathers are favourites of
God, who directs their ways, and protects
and blesses them in all their doings. He
appears to them in human form, and converses
with them as a man with his friends; reflection
has not yet found such too human
behaviour unbecoming in God. Gen. 18 is a
striking instance of this familiarity in the
deity: Jehovah with two companions comes
to Abraham's tent, eats of the meal the patriarch's
hospitality provides, predicts that
Sarah shall bear a son before the year is out&mdash;a
prospect which moves the old woman
listening behind the door to incredulous
merriment&mdash;and as he departs announces
that he is going down to Sodom to see whether
they are as bad there as has been reported to
him. A still more drastic example is the
"man" who wrestles with Jacob, and finding
himself no match for the brawny patriarch,
disables him by a foul, putting his hip out of
joint, and finally, to get loose, unmasks as a
god, owns Jacob the winner, and names him
"Israel," the man who held his own against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a god (Gen. xxxii. 24 ff.). Or, again, as Moses
is on the way to Egypt by God's command to
deliver his people, Jehovah encounters him
where he halts for the night, and tries to kill
him, desisting only when Zipporah bans him
by smearing her imperilled husband with the
bloody foreskin of her son (Exod. iv. 24 ff.).</p>

<p>Such extremely human representations
belong to the ancient legends which are incorporated
in the history; the author's own
conception of God, if we may judge him by
passages like Exod. xxxiii. 12-23; xxxiv.
6-9, was much less crude; but it is significant
that such traits were allowed to remain with
so little change.</p>

<p>The legends also attribute to God a partiality
for the patriarchs which lets him protect and
prosper them in transactions such as are
repugnant not only to the most rudimentary
morality but to savage manliness, as in Gen.
12 and 26, variants of the story how one of the
forefathers exposed his wife's honour rather
than risk his own neck. Less striking, but
no less instructive, is Jacob, who gains the
birthright by overreaching his brother and
the blessing of the first-born by deceiving his
father, and in the end outwits the wily Laban
at his own devices and grows rich at his
expense. It would be a mistake to take such
stories as reflecting the morality of the
author's time: they were the traditions of
another age and another order of things.
But again it is significant that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
narrated in J without any visible attempt
to mitigate their offensive features. Other
authors, as we shall see, toned down these
features or eliminated them.</p>

<p>The second of the authors in the patriarchal
history (E) is but little inferior to J as
narrator, and in translation the difference is
even less noticeable than in the original.
Where they can be directly compared, however,
E is slightly less vivid and picturesque.
A certain learned, or antiquarian, interest is
also apparent. E notes, for instance, that
Laban, who as a Syrian naturally spoke
Aramaic, called the boundary cairn Jegar
Sahaduta, while Jacob named it in good
Hebrew Gal 'Ed (a popular etymology of
Gilead), and that the ancestors of the Israelites
in their old homes beyond the Euphrates were
heathen. He is particularly well informed
in things Egyptian; he knows, for example,
the Egyptian names of the chief personages
in the story of Joseph. It is in accord with this
tendency that he introduces the name Jehovah
only after the call of Moses (Exod. iii. 14 ff.),
and for the patriarchal period employs only
the appellative, God.</p>

<p>The conception of deity is less naïve than in
J: God never appears in tangible bodiliness
like a man, but reveals himself in visions or
dreams, or makes known his will by a voice
out of the unseen. Things objectionable to
morals or taste are frequently softened down.
In J, for example, Joseph's brothers, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Judah's instance, sell him to the Ishmaelites;
in E Reuben persuades them to put Joseph
into a dry well, intending to save him from
them and restore him to his father; while he
is absent, Midianites steal Joseph out of the
well and carry him off to Egypt. Compare
also Gen. 20 (E) with c. 12 (J), noting how in
the former the author takes pains to make
clear that no harm came to Sarah, and that
Abraham is a prophet whose intercession is
effectual with God. On the other hand, the
interventions of God in E often show a disposition
to magnify the miracle and to give
it a magical character. Thus at the crossing
of the Red Sea, in J the waters are driven back
by a strong wind, leaving the shallow basin
dry; in E the miracle is wrought by Moses
with his wand (like the plagues), and this
representation is followed by P, in which the
waters stand in walls on either hand while the
people march between.</p>

<p>If the author of E was acquainted with J,
as it would be natural to assume, he certainly
does not copy him; of literary dependence
in a strict sense there is no sign. The two
appear, rather, to be parallel narratives,
drawing on a common stock of tradition,
which had already acquired by repetition,
whether oral or written, a comparatively
fixed form. This common stock included
traditions of different groups of tribes and of
holy places in different parts of the land. As
might be supposed, the tribes seated in central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Palestine, with their kinsmen east of the
Jordan, which constituted the strength of the
kingdom of Israel, make the largest contribution;
Judah with its allied clans in the south
comes second.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the common tradition
in J and E, respectively, local or national
interests appear, from which it is generally
inferred that E was written in the Northern
Kingdom (Israel) and J in the Southern
(Judah). The question of the age of these
writings can be more profitably considered at
a later stage of our inquiry.</p>

<p>The patriarchal history which begins with
the migration of Abraham, Gen. 12, is preceded
by what may be called the primeval history of
mankind, Gen. 1-11. In these chapters E is
not represented, and it seems probable that
the Israelite historian began his book with
Abraham. The primeval history as we read
it, therefore, is derived in part from J, in part
from P. From J come Gen. ii. 4b-iv. 25;
vi. 1-8; a part of the composite story of the
Flood (vii. 1-5, 7-10, 12, 17b, 22-23; viii.
6-12, 13b, 20-22); the sons of Noah, ix.
18-27, and part of the table of nations (x.
8-19, 21, 24-30); the Tower of Babel (xi.
1-9). These pieces do not form a literary
unity, and they give evidence, as we should
expect, of diverse origin. There are some
among them which imply a continuous development
of civilization, unbroken by the catastrophe
of the Deluge, and Noah himself was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
originally an agricultural figure, the first
vine-dresser and maker of wine, not the
navigator of the ark. The tradition which
ascribes the invention of the arts of primitive
civilization to descendants of Cain (Gen. iv.
17-24) is obviously of different origin from
the story of Cain and Abel. Closer inspection
shows that the narrative of J in Gen. 1-11 is
composed of two strands, each having a consistency
and continuity of its own, and similar
phenomena appear in subsequent parts of the
history from Genesis to Samuel.</p>

<p>If these various elements are alike designated
by the symbol J, it is because they
exhibit the peculiarities of conception and
expression which characterize that work.
The God who walks for pleasure in his garden
in the cool of the day, misses his gardeners,
and finding that they have eaten the forbidden
fruit of the tree of knowledge, drives them out
of the garden for fear they might also put out
their hands to the tree whose fruit gives
immortality, or who comes down to see the
tower the Babylonian heaven-stormers are
building, and apprehending more presumptuous
attempts from their success, breaks up
their concert by the ingenious device of making
them talk different languages, is plainly
imagined in quite the same way as the God
who visits Abraham on his way to Sodom or
wrestles with Jacob or tries to kill Moses on
the road to Egypt. Even more primitive is
the fragment, Gen. vi. 1-4, telling how deities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
captivated by the charms of mortal women,
begot with them a mythical race of giants.</p>

<p>The Deluge has long been known to be a
Babylonian myth, which now forms an episode
in a poem celebrating the exploits of a hero
named Gilgamesh. But, though preserving
even such details of the Babylonian original
as the sending out of the birds, the Hebrew
author has impressed upon it the stamp of
his own religion, effacing its polytheistic
features, and making the Flood a just judgment
on universal sinfulness; while for the
Babylonian hero he substituted a figure of
Palestinian legend, and shows his inland
bringing-up by converting the ship into an
enormous box. It has frequently been assumed
or asserted that others of these myths of the
early world, particularly the Garden in Eden
and the Tower of Babel, are also of Babylonian
origin, but no parallels to them have as yet
been discovered, nor does internal evidence
point that way.</p>

<p>The scenery in the Garden in Eden is naïve
enough, but the problem of the myth is one
which has exercised the minds of men through
all time: Why is man mortal? or, as it is
usually put in myths, How did man fail of
immortality? Two other persistent questions
are here joined with it, Why has man to work
so hard for a living? and Why must women
bear children with pangs and peril? The
answer evinces a reflection of which we often
think primitive philosophy incapable: man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
aspired to a knowledge that God jealously kept
to himself&mdash;he would not respect his limitations.</p>

<p>The third chief narrative source in the Pentateuch,
commonly called the Priestly History
(P), is of a different character from those which
we have been examining. A more descriptive
title for it would be, Origins of the Religious
Institutions of Israel. In the view of the
author, these institutions were successively
ordained by God at certain epochs in the
history of mankind and in connection with
certain historical events; these events he
narrates as the occasion or ground of the
institution, which the subsequent observance
recalls and commemorates. These institutions
were not all first revealed to Israel and
prescribed for it; on the contrary, the author
has a theory of a progressive revelation of
God's will, beginning with the first man and
woman, and amplified from age to age by the
addition to its contents of fresh ordinances,
while at the same time its extension gradually
narrows, until, in the Mosaic Law, it is
addressed to the chosen people of Israel alone.
The place of each new institution is therefore
fixed not only in a chronological system but
in the genealogical scheme of races and nations.
The genealogies which connect one epoch of
revelation with the following one are thus
not the bare bones of history, stripped of its
flesh and blood, but serve a distinct and
characteristic purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>The Origins begin with the creation of the
world (Gen. i.-ii. 4), and a comparison of
this account with that of J in 2-3 well illustrates
the difference between the two sources.
The God of P is not one who fashions man
and beast out of clay and breathes with his
own lips into the work of his hands the breath
of life; he stands above and apart from the
world, and creates all things by fiat: "Let
there be light, and there was light"&mdash;so in
sublime simplicity the formula runs. The
creative acts are six natural days: "Evening
came and morning came, a first day." "And
he rested (kept sabbath) on the seventh day
from all his work which he had made. And
God blessed the seventh day and made it holy,
because on it he rested from all his creative
work." The ordinance of the sabbath thus
has its origin and sanction in the creation itself,
and this is alleged in the Decalogue (Exod.
xx. 11) as the motive for man's sabbath-keeping.</p>

<p>The Flood gives occasion to the blessing of
Noah and his sons, in which for the first time
animal food is permitted&mdash;like many of the
ancients, P made the first men vegetarians&mdash;and
with this licence is coupled a prohibition
of flesh with blood in it and the sentence of
God upon murder, "Whoso sheddeth man's
blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for
in the image of God made he man." These
commandments, given to Noah, are binding
on all mankind, his descendants. The genealogies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the antediluvians connect the
creation with the Flood and serve also the
chronology; genealogies of the descendants
of Noah's sons follow, the chronology attaching
to the line of Shem down to Terah, the father
of Abraham.</p>

<p>Abraham's migration to Canaan and the
birth of Ishmael are briefly told, and then, at
large, the covenant with Abraham, the
promise of a son by Sarah, and the institution
of circumcision, which is an ordinance for all
the Abrahamic peoples, the Arab descendants
of Ishmael as well as the Israelites and Edomites
sprung from Isaac, and for their slaves,
home-born or foreign. The only other incident
in Abraham's life of which P gives a fuller
account is the purchase from the sons of Heth
of the cave of Macpelah, the burial-place of
the patriarchs; meagre notices of marriages
and deaths, and tedious pedigrees take the
place of the vivid stories of J and E. The
contrast is most striking in the case of Joseph,
about whom we have from P only a few verses.
Doubtless this is in part due to the fact that
the author of the Pentateuch preferred the
richer narrative of his other sources, but what
is preserved of P shows clearly enough that
his history of Joseph, even when complete,
was brief and dry.</p>

<p>The diction and style of P are very unlike
that of J and E; a favourable example of
his manner is Gen. 17. Even in a translation,
which necessarily obliterates much, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the author's peculiarities can be observed,
foremost among them a certain stiffness and
a laborious circumstantiality, which will be
felt if Gen. xvi. 1-2, 4-8, 11-14 (J) or xvi.
8-21 (E) be compared with c. 17 (P). In
Gen. 1, thanks to the subject, this dry simplicity
gives an impression of sublimity;
but in general, narration is not the author's
best gift. On the other hand, the conception
of God, as we have seen in Gen. 1, is more
elevated than in either of the other sources;
and in the little P tells of the patriarchs their
deportment is unimpeachable.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>EXODUS, LEVITICUS, NUMBERS</h3>


<p>In the early chapters of Exodus the narrative
is chiefly a combination of J and E; the first
considerable extract from P is Exod. vi.
2-vii. 13, recalling the covenant with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and announcing its approaching
fulfilment, adding, as the signature of the
new epoch of the history now opening, the
revelation of the name God, Jehovah (Jahveh),
which none of the patriarchs had known.</p>

<p>In the story of the plagues all three sources
are interwoven; a distinctive feature of P is
that Aaron with his wand, under Moses'
direction, brings the plagues to pass. The
announcement of the last plague is the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for P to introduce the ordinance of the Passover.
The houses of the Israelites are to be
marked by the blood of the victim on the
door-posts and lintel: when Jehovah passes
through the land, smiting dead all the first-born
of the Egyptians, he will "skip" the
houses so protected&mdash;thus the name of the
feast is explained (Exod. xii. 1-13). To this
is annexed a law for the observance of the
feast of Unleavened Bread, which in Palestine
immediately followed the Passover (xii. 14-20).
With the institution of the Passover is connected
also a change in the calendar: henceforth
the month of the vernal full moon
(March-April) is to be the first of the year.
It was so in the ecclesiastical calendar of
later times, but the civil New Year was, and
still is, in the Autumn.</p>

<p>All the strands of the triple narrative lead
to a holy mountain in the desert (Sinai in P
and probably in J; Horeb in E and D), the
Mount of God, represented in all as the
ancient seat of Jehovah. It was on this
mountain that God appeared to Moses and
bade him return to Egypt to deliver Israel:
when he had brought the people out of Egypt
they should worship at this mountain.
Thither, therefore, Moses directs their way
after crossing the Red Sea. In all the sources
God's presence is manifested by cloud and
fire upon the mountain, and Moses goes to the
summit to meet God (Exod. 19, J, E; xxiv.
15<small><sup>b</sup></small>-18<small><sup>a</sup></small>, P). These imposing preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
portend a revelation of no common moment;
and the whole situation bids us expect the
organic law of the religion of Jehovah, the
things which he requires of his worshippers.</p>

<p>We find, in fact, in each of the three sources
at this point larger or smaller groups of laws
purporting to be delivered to Moses at the holy
mountain, and containing what may be
regarded as fundamental institutions. These
bodies of law are, however, very different;
the problem of their relation to one another
and to the narratives is extremely difficult,
and the parallel account of the legislation at
Horeb in Deut. 5 adds another element to the
complication. If the reader will attentively
compare Exod. 20; 21-23; 24; Deut. 5;
ix. 8-x. 5; and Exod. 34, he will get some
impression of the nature of the difficulties.
According to Deut. v. 22, the Decalogue
(Deut. v. 6-21; Exod. xx. 1-17, with noteworthy
variants) was the law written on the
two tables of stone by the hand of God which
Moses dashed down and shattered when he
saw the people wantoning around the golden
calf (Exod. xxxii. 19). God proposes to
reproduce the law on two new tablets (xxxiv.
1), but the Decalogue (xxxiv. 28) written on
these tablets (xxxiv. 14-26) is wholly different
from that of Exod. 20, being not a compend
of moral law, but prescriptions for the festivals
and ritual rules, whereas Deut. ix. 8-x. 5 says
in so many words that it was the Decalogue
of v. 6-21 which was restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>It is impossible to discuss these problems
here. It must suffice to say that they arise
in part from the attempt to harmonize radically
different representations of what the
fundamental law given at Sinai (or Horeb)
was, in part from the tendency of later times
to ascribe to the original Mosaic legislation
the whole body of actual law regarded as having
a religious sanction. To the latter cause we
may without hesitation attribute, for example,
the introduction of the fragmentary remains
of a Palestinian civil code in Exod. 21-22,
to which other remnants of diverse origin have
been attached, as well as the great mass of
ritual and ceremonial laws which are thrust
into the framework of P.</p>

<p>The fundamental law of J, the basis of the
original compact between Jehovah and Israel,
is preserved in Exod. xxxiv. 1-5, 10a, 14-28
(with some manifest amplifications in vss. 15,
16, 24). When this was combined with the
story of the golden calf and the broken tables
(E), it was necessary to take it as a <i>renewal</i> of
the law, and this was accomplished by very
slight additions in vss. 1 and 4 ("like unto the
first," "that were on the first tables, which
thou brakest").</p>

<p>What the Horeb constitution in E originally
was, is less confidently to be determined. In
the form in which E was read by the authors
of Deut. 5 and of ix. 8-x. 5 (end of the seventh
century or later), it was the Decalogue <i>only</i>
(Deut. v. 22 f.); but it is not certain that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was the oldest representation. There are
other evidences that E was revised and
enlarged in the seventh century by an author
who was influenced by the prophets, particularly
by Hosea; and the story of the golden
calf (with which the Decalogue narrative is
closely connected), a condemnation in advance
of the Israelite worship of Jehovah in the
image of a bull, may have been introduced in
this edition, as the repudiation of the sacrifice
of children to Jehovah in the story of Abraham
and Isaac (Gen. 22) probably was.</p>

<p>In P the case is clearer. According to his
theory all the ordinances of worship were
revealed at Sinai. Legitimate sacrifice presupposes
one legitimate temple and altar, a
legitimate priesthood, and a minutely prescribed
ritual. In J and E the patriarchs set
up altars and offer sacrifice in many places;
it is an obvious interest of the authors, or
of the local legends of holy places which they
follow, to trace the origin of the altars,
sacred stones, holy trees and wells, at Shechem
or Bethel, Hebron or Beersheba, to one of the
forefathers. In P, on the contrary, the
patriarchs never offer sacrifice. Until the
tabernacle was erected and God's presence
filled it, until Aaron was consecrated as priest,
until the technique of the various species of
offering had been revealed by God and exemplified
by Moses or Aaron, no sacrifice could be
anything but impious, like the worship of
heathen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Accordingly, the first thing God does when
Moses goes up into the mount is to give him
plans and specifications for a sacred tent&mdash;a
portable temple&mdash;with all its furniture, an
altar for sacrifice in the court before it, the
vestments of the priests, and the apparatus
of the high-priestly oracle, and to reveal in
detail the ritual for the consecration of priests
(Exod. 25-30). The making of the tabernacle
and all the other things necessary for the
complete cultus is described in Exod. 35-40;
the consecration of the priests and the inaugural
sacrifices by Aaron in Lev. 8-9;
Lev. x. 1-7 is closely connected with cc. 8-9,
and its sequel (combined with other matter)
is found in c. 16, the ritual of atonement.
Lev. 8-9 is a good specimen of the author's
method. In the form of a description of the
sacrifices of consecration and the inaugural
sacrifices of Aaron, he gives a paradigm for
every variety of offering.</p>

<p>Here was obviously a natural place to
introduce laws prescribing the ritual of these
species of sacrifice and the circumstances which
demand them, and accordingly we find in Lev.
1-7 a collection of such laws, some of them
(e.g. Lev. 1 and 3) unquestionably old both
in substance and formulation, with slight
adaptation to their surrounding (e.g. "the
sons of Aaron," i. 5, etc.), or with supplements
to meet new economic and social conditions,
such as the burnt offering of doves
(Lev. i. 14-17, cf. vs. 2); others are younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or have been more extensively enlarged and
amended. The chapters thus represent a
growth in actual custom and corresponding
rule. In c. 4 we may observe an example of
another kind of legal growth, namely, the
systematic development of principles or ideas.
The scale of sin-offerings, graduated by the
social station of the sinner&mdash;the high priest,
the whole people, the prince, a common
citizen&mdash;is consistently thought out in conformity
with a theory. Observe that the
prince is assigned a modest place next the
bottom, below the religious community corporately,
while the priest takes his at the
top. We can say with full confidence that this
elaborate ritual is not the booking of usage,
but is a product of sacerdotal theory; and,
further, that so long as kings reigned, the most
high-church ecclesiastic is not likely to have
arrogated so much to himself, or, at least, to
have proclaimed his ambitions. Only in days
when, under foreign governors, the high priest
was really the greatest man in the community
is such a table of precedence conceivable.
Whether even then this law was actually put
in operation, may be an open question.</p>

<p>The position of the sacrificial laws, Lev.
1-7, explains itself, as has been said. In
many other cases, however, we see no reason
why a subject is brought in where it is.
Thus, Lev. 11-15, on various forms of uncleanness
and the prescribed purifications, to which
x. 10 f. seems to be a fragmentary introduction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have no obvious association with anything in
the context, though they are introduced
appropriately enough before the general
purification of the Day of Atonement, c. 16.
The laws, which read like the chapters of an
exactly formulated code of purity, have been
expanded by the addition of new paragraphs
(e.g. Lev. xiv. 21-32, 33-53), and in some cases
changes in the ritual may be recognized;
compare, for example, Lev. xiv. 1-8 with
vss. 10-20.</p>

<p>Chapters 17-26 form a distinct body of law,
having certain marked peculiarities of its
own, notably the frequent recurrence of the
motive of "holiness"&mdash;that is, the avoidance
of things and actions tabooed by the religion
of Israel&mdash;often coupled with the appeal to
God's holiness, as in xix. 2, "Ye shall be holy,
for I, Jehovah, your God, am holy," or simply
asserting his authority, "I am Jehovah."
On the other hand, much in the laws of this
Holiness Book (H), as it now stands, has close
affinity to the mass of ritual and ceremonial
laws in Leviticus and Numbers. The hypothesis
which seems best to explain the phenomena
is that an independent collection of
laws (or rather the remains of such a collection),
characterized by the motive of holiness,
has been expanded and edited in the spirit
and manner of the priestly legislation, while
some laws which were originally included in
this collection have been transposed to other
contexts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>The Holiness Book closed with an earnest
exhortation and warning to observe all these
laws, promising the blessing of God on obedience
and depicting in strong colours the
calamities with which he will punish defection
(Lev. 26). The position and prophetic tenour
of this chapter resemble Deut. 28, and the
book in its original form is apparently the
product of the same age with Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>The Origins (P) described in Exod. 28 f. and
Lev. 8 f. the choice of Aaron and his sons to
be priests and their installation in the sacred
office. The inferior order of the ministry of
the sanctuary, the levites, is not as yet
instituted. This is done in Numbers, and
indeed with a certain redundancy, for Num.
3 and 4 independently deal with the subject,
and c. 18 takes it up afresh without any
allusion to a previous appointment. Much
stress is laid on the exclusive prerogative of
Aaron and his sons in the service of the altar
and the ministry "within the veil"; no
levite, much less a layman, may presume to
these sacred functions on pain of death. The
levites are given to Aaron and his sons as
temple slaves for the menial work of the
sanctuary, in place of the first-born Israelites
of all tribes who would naturally be dedicated
to God, i.e. to the temple. Yet, as ministers
of religion, they are supported by a general
tithe of the products of the soil imposed on
all the people.</p>

<p>The laws in Numbers present the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
variety as in Leviticus. There are old laws
with modifications and enlargements, and
many others which by various signs betray a
more recent origin. Num. 28-36 belong as a
whole to the latter class; cc. 28 f. exemplify
that growth of the law by the formulation of
sacerdotal ideals or desiderata which has been
noted in the case of Lev. 4. It is to be
observed that the narrative of P has reached
in Num. xxvii. 12-23 the end of Moses'
career; nothing is in place after it but the
ascent of Mt. Abarim and Moses' death
(Deut. 34). Num. 28-36 thus stand even
formally in the place of an appendix.</p>

<p>The narrative of P (Origin of the Religious
Institutions) and the great mass of ritual and
ceremonial laws in the three middle books of
the Pentateuch are often called collectively
the Priests' Code. The name naturally suggests
to the English reader an orderly body of
law, compiled, revised, and promulgated by
some authority; and, in fact, many critics&mdash;except
for the orderliness, which nobody has
ventured to affirm, and with allowance for
later additions&mdash;regard the Priests' Code as
such a law book, compiled and edited by
priestly scribes in Babylonia, brought to
Judæa by Ezra, with the authority of the
Persian king, to reform the many disorders
that existed there, and ratified and put in
force in <small>B.C.</small> 444 by the magnates and the
people of the Jews. (See Ezra 7; Neh. 8-10,
and below, pp. 129 ff.) Internal evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
such an origin and destination is, however,
sought in vain in the laws; the things that
Ezra and Nehemiah were most zealous about,
especially the veto on mixed marriages,
do not stand out in the so-called Priests' Code
as they do in other parts of the law, while
about a reform of the cultus in Jerusalem
in conformity with a new ritual introduced
from Babylonia, the story of Ezra's doings
is significantly silent.</p>

<p>The phenomena we have observed in
Exodus-Numbers suggest the hypothesis,
rather, that various old laws, dealing chiefly
with sacrifice and with the rules of clean and
unclean&mdash;the two principal subjects of priestly
regulation&mdash;were inserted at suitable points
in the Origins of the Religious Institutions
(P); these received amendments and supplements
both before and after their incorporation;
other more independent developments,
whether representing actual custom or sacerdotal
aspirations, found place among or
beside them; and thus the whole Priestly
stratum grew by a process of accretion
through many generations into its present
inorganic magnitude. It is antecedently
probable that this process went on in Palestine,
where the ritual laws were a practical concern,
rather than in the schools of Babylonia;
and only strong evidence to the contrary
could overcome this presumption.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>DEUTERONOMY</h3>


<p>Deuteronomy purports to contain the laws
under which Israel is to live in the land of
Canaan. It deals with the conditions of an
agricultural people, settled in towns and
villages, in the presence of a native population
to the contamination of whose religion and
morals the Israelites are exposed. This
legislation was revealed to Moses at Horeb
(Deut. v. 28-33), but, inasmuch as it was not
to go into effect until Israel was established
in the possession of Canaan, being in fact
wholly inapplicable to nomadic conditions&mdash;a
consideration of which P, in its code of
worship, is oblivious&mdash;it was not promulgated
till the moment when the people, encamped
opposite Jericho, was on the point of invading
Palestine. Then the aged Moses, about to
lay down his office and his life, delivers to the
people, in national assembly, the law by which
they are in future to be governed, and adds
his most urgent injunctions and solemn
warnings to be faithful to their religion and
the law of their God.</p>

<p>The book is thus almost wholly in the form
of address, and the hortatory note is insistent.
As an introduction, Moses briefly recalls the
history of the wanderings, from Horeb on,
impressing at every turn the lessons of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
experience (Deut. 1-3); the material is taken
chiefly from E's narrative, which it was intended
to supersede in an independent Book
of Deuteronomy. There follows a hortatory
discourse (iv. 1-40), closely akin to cc. 29-30.
The last acts and the death of Moses are
narrated in confused fashion in c. 31; xxxii.
48-52; 34. The Song of Moses (c. 32), and
the Blessing of Moses (c. 33), are apparently
independent compositions which have been
given an appropriate place at the end of the
book. The core of Deuteronomy is cc. 5-11;
12-26; 28. Speaking generally, the first
part (cc. 5-11) expounds the fundamental
principles of religion, while the second (cc.
12-26) contains special laws, and, as a fitting
and effective conclusion of the whole, c. 28
sets forth the blessings which God will bestow
on Israel if it keeps his commandments,
and the curses it will incur by unfaithfulness
and disobedience. The special laws, particularly
in Deut. 22 ff., are similar in character
to those in Exod. 21-23 and in Lev. 17-25,
and doubtless embody in the main ancient
custom; but beside them are provisions of
a singularly Utopian kind, such as those
on the conduct of war in c. 20 and the septennial
cancelling of all debts (xv. 1-11).</p>

<p>The conception of religion which dominates
the whole book, but is most conspicuous in
cc. 5-11, is the highest in the Old Testament.
There is but one God, supreme in might and
majesty, constant in purpose, faithful to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
word, just but compassionate; he is not
to be imaged or imagined in the likeness
of anything in heaven or on earth; idolatry,
divination, and sorcery are strictly forbidden.
The essence of religion is love (Deut. vi. 4),
the love of God to his people and their responsive
love to him is the ruling motive in worship
and conduct. In the relations of men to
their fellows, whether countrymen or strangers
and to the brute creation, humanity and
charity are the prime virtues; the Utopian
features of the laws are such only because
they push the ideal of humanity too hard
for unideal human nature.</p>

<p>What is most characteristic in the Deuteronomic
legislation, the thing on which it dwells
with insistent iteration, is that Jehovah will
be worshipped only at one place, to be chosen
by himself in the territory of one of the tribes.
There all sacrifices must be offered, all festivals
celebrated. At the head of the special laws
this fundamental article is repeatedly laid
down (Deut. xii. 13-19&mdash;seemingly the oldest
formulation&mdash;xii. 2-7, 8-12, 20-27), and it
recurs in connection with the laws concerning
the disposition of God's share in man's increase
(tithes, firstlings, etc.) and the annual festivals
(Passover, Tabernacles).</p>

<p>This was an innovation which dislocated
the whole system of religious observances,
and the Deuteronomic legislation had to
provide for the direct and indirect consequences
of so radical a change. By ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
custom the religious dues were rendered and
sacrifices offered at the village altars ("high
places"), and there also the festivals were
kept which marked the seasons of the husbandman's
year; beside the altar, with a simple
religious rite, domestic animals were slaughtered
whenever hospitality or a family festival
gave occasion. If a man visited a more
renowned sanctuary at a distance from his
home, he did it of his own accord and in his
own time and way. The feasts at the village
altars, at which custom prescribed open
hospitality, were a godsend to the poor of the
community, many of whom would else seldom
have tasted flesh or eaten their fill. The
Deuteronomic law licenses the slaughter of
animals at home without any religious rite,
and introduces a plan of charity tithes to
replace the hospitality of the altar. Its
concern for the levites (that is, the priests
of the local sanctuaries), who by the new
arrangement were left without a livelihood,
is also to be noted.</p>

<p>The motives for this radical change in
immemorial religious custom are characteristic.
In the first place, the "high places"
had been seats of Canaanite worship before
they were taken possession of by the Israelites,
and not only did the stigma of aboriginal
heathenism cling to them, but, in fact, many
heathenish doings were perpetuated at them&mdash;drunken
debauches and consecrated prostitution.
But, further, their existence seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to be incompatible with strict monotheism:
the many gods were worshipped in many
places; the <i>one</i> God seemed to have as
corollary <i>one</i> place of worship. As a matter
of experience, the localizing of Jehovah
at numerous sanctuaries&mdash;Dan, Bethel, Gilgal,
Beersheba&mdash;with their distinctive traditions
and local peculiarities of ritual, doubtless
did result, for the apprehension of the common
man, in making a local Jehovah, as
happens to the Virgin and the Saints in
Catholic countries. For the Deuteronomist
this was only another kind of polytheism:
"Hear, O Israel, Jehovah, our God, is <i>one</i>
Jehovah!"</p>

<p>Deuteronomy is, therefore, the programme
of a reform. Fortunately, we know how this
programme was put in execution; the history
of it is written in 2 Kings 22-23. In the course
of some repairs in the temple in Jerusalem,
a law book turned up, the reading of which
threw King Josiah and his advisers into consternation.
After taking counsel of a prophetess,
an assembly was convoked, and the book
publicly ratified by the notables and the people
as the law of the realm. Thereupon the king
proceeded to put the code in force. He not
only cleaned house in the temple in Jerusalem,
where a miscellany of foreign gods and cults
was installed, but he destroyed and desecrated
all the "high places," that is, the immemorial
seats of the worship of Jehovah in the towns
and villages of his kingdom, pulling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
altars to pieces, smashing the stone pillars,
hewing down the sacred poles, and forcibly
carrying off the priests (levites) to Jerusalem,
where he assigned them a living from the
income of the temple, but&mdash;in his zeal going
beyond the law of Deut. xviii. 6-8&mdash;excluded
them from sacrificial functions.</p>

<p>It was seen long ago by some of the Church
Fathers that the law book which Hilkiah
found and Josiah enforced can have been no
other than Deuteronomy. The historian of
the kingdoms, writing after the reforms of
Josiah and the following reaction and believing
that the prohibition of worship at the high
places had been binding since the building of
Solomon's temple, is at pains to say that
none of the kings from Solomon to Josiah,
not even those to whom otherwise he gives
the best mark for piety, had paid any attention
to this law, with the sole exception of a brief
attempt by Hezekiah. We can go further,
and say that none of the older historians
and none of the prophets of the ninth and
eighth centuries show any acquaintance with
such a prohibition. If the prophets assail
the worship at the high places, as Hosea
does, it is on the ground that it is heathenish
and immoral, not that it is illegitimate;
if Hosea condemns the pilgrimages to Gilgal
and Beersheba, it is not implied that it would
be better to go to Jerusalem; nor, indeed,
is any condemnation of the worship at the
high places more drastic than Isaiah's of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cultus in Jerusalem. Before the latter part
of the seventh century there is no thought
that Jehovah has such an exclusive preference
for Solomon's temple.</p>

<p>All the other evidence in Deuteronomy
points to the same age. Its conception of
God and of religion is derived from the
prophets of the eighth century. The influence
of Hosea is particularly plain: that the
essence of religion is love is Hosea's idea,
if there is such a thing as originality in
religion. The language and style of Deuteronomy
are of the seventh century, in its excellences
and in its defects; Jeremiah and
the author of Kings have the closest resemblance
to it in its rhetorical manner and in
its peculiar pathos.</p>

<p>On these grounds, since the latter part
of the eighteenth century, an increasing
number of scholars have held that the book
was written in the second half of the seventh
century for the purpose of bringing about a
revolution such as actually followed its well-timed
discovery; and this is now the opinion
of almost all who admit that the common
principles of historical criticism are applicable
to Biblical literature.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy is not all of one piece, as has
already been pointed out. Many older laws
were taken up into it at the beginning or
introduced subsequently; considerable additions
were made to it after Josiah's time, and
even after the fall of Judah, for in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
passages that catastrophe and the dispersion
of the people are an accomplished fact,
an existing situation. It is only the reform
programme and what hangs together with it
that can be definitely dated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>AGE OF THE SOURCES, COMPOSITION OF THE
PENTATEUCH</h3>


<p>Deuteronomy is a fixed point, by reference
to which the age of other strata in the Pentateuch
may be determined, at least relatively.
Thus in P the patriarchs never offer sacrifice
at the ancient holy places of Canaan, and the
notion that legitimate sacrifice can be made
only on one altar is so fundamental an article
of religion that the first thing at Sinai is the
construction of the tabernacle to be transported
from one station to another in the
desert. The inference is plain that P was
written at a time when the principle of the
unity of the sanctuary for which Deuteronomy
contends with the zeal of innovation was no
longer disputed, at least in the author's surroundings,
so that he has no need to enjoin
it, and can, indeed, ignore the fact that there
ever had been other sanctuaries of Jehovah.
Such a state of things never existed while
the kingdom stood; it was only in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Persian period, when Judæa was reduced to
a circle of a few miles about Jerusalem,
that the conditions implied in P arose. Only
in that age, through political circumstances,
did the high priests attain the pre-eminence
to which P gives the sanction of divine right;
and P itself not obscurely witnesses that these
towering pretensions did not go unchallenged
(see especially Num. 16). With this all the
other evidence concurs: the supramundane
conception of God and the avoidance of
everything that seems to bring the deity into
too close contact with earthly things or tempts
the imagination to figure him too humanly
speak of the progress of theological reflection.
The language is plainly in decadence:
apart from words which seem to be
new, and occasionally foreign, the sentence
is losing its flexibility, or authors are losing
their mastery of it; it is only necessary to
compare even the best passages in P (such as
Gen. 23) with examples of really classical
Hebrew prose (say, in 2 Sam. 11 ff. or the
stories of Elijah in Kings), on the one hand,
and with the writing of the Chronicler (third
century <small>B.C.</small>), on the other, to see that P
is nearer to the latter than to the former.</p>

<p>The age of the laws now set in the framework
of the Origins is a distinct question,
or rather, as will be understood from what
has been said above, it is a separate question
for every law, and often for successive paragraphs
of the same law. And behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
question of the age of the law in its present
formulation is frequently the remoter problem
of the age of the institution or custom.
Various criteria are available in the history
of the Kingdoms, in the prophets, in other
collections of laws, and in Ezekiel's programme
for the New Jerusalem (Ezek. 40 ff.). It must
be enough here to say that the older laws in
P go back, substantially in their present shape,
to the days of the kingdom, and in many
cases represent a prescriptive usage which is
of remote antiquity; while the latest additions
to P were made at a time so recent that they
had not found entry into the copies from which
the earliest Greek version was made in the
third century <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>J and E are both older than Deuteronomy.
In Genesis, as has already been noted, they
recite the foundation legends of Shechem,
Bethel, Hebron, Beersheba, and other of the
holy places of Canaan, telling how the patriarchs
built the altars, set up the sacred stones,
planted the sacred trees, dug the holy wells,
and offered sacrifice to their own God at these
spots, by this origin legitimating as Israelite
sanctuaries what were, at the time of the
conquest and long after, Canaanite "high
places." Similarly, in Joshua, Gilgal and
Shiloh are Israelite foundations. These were
all, in the time of the kingdoms, holy places
of great repute, frequented by pilgrims from
distant quarters; but there were others, of
less ancient pretensions, which attained equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
celebrity. Dan, for instance, which came
into the hands of the Israelites in the time
of the Judges, claimed a priesthood descended
from Moses, and became proverbial for the
tenacity with which the good old traditions
of Israel were preserved there.</p>

<p>The narratives in Judges, Samuel, and
Kings show that every town and village had
its own holy place, with an altar and a sacred
stone, and sometimes a hall for feasts (e.g.
1 Sam. ix. 22), and that temporary altars
were built whenever and wherever there was
reason. This practice is presumed in an
ancient fragment of a law, Exod. xx. 24-26,
which prescribes that all offerings must be
made at an altar, which may be a mound of
earth or a heap of field-stones (not hewn
stone), and promises that at every place where
God has given signs of his presence he will
come to the sacrifice and bless the offerer.
This rule, which probably originally stood in
the context of J, expressly sanctions the
local altars and sacrifices which are so abhorrent
to the deuteronomic reformers of the
seventh century.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the strong interest in
the origins of the holy places of Canaan
indicates that when J and E were written
these high places were Israelite sanctuaries,
which had as such their sacred legends;
indeed, a considerable part of the patriarchal
stories is ultimately derived from these
legends of local sanctuaries, which form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
cycle, harmonized and connected by a migration
motive. That both J and E were written
long after the settlement of the Israelites
in Palestine is proved even more conclusively
by the fact that the obligatory religious
observances are those of an agricultural
people. Thus in Exod. 34, in what was
probably according to J the organic law of
the religion of Jehovah, and is indisputably
the oldest collection of religious laws in the
Pentateuch, three festivals are ordained, at
which every male is bound "to see the face
of Jehovah," that is, to appear at the high
place with his offering&mdash;he is warned not to
try to "see Jehovah" without something in
his hands&mdash;namely, the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, the Feast of Weeks,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the Feast of
Ingathering in the end of the year. The first
of these, as we know, came at the beginning
of the barley harvest, at the second the firstfruits
of the wheat harvest were presented,
the third celebrated the close of the vintage
and the olive-pressing. The firstlings of the
flock and herd, if we may infer from the order
of the prescriptions, were to be offered at the
feast of Unleavened Bread in the Spring.
The sabbath is to be kept as a day of abstention
from agricultural labour, "even in ploughing-time
and harvest thou shalt rest." The
occupations of a nomad go on one day like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
another; the care of the flocks cannot be
suspended for sabbath-keeping.</p>

<p>It is difficult to reconstruct the narratives
of the exodus and the wanderings in the
desert in J and E as they originally were.
Extensive transpositions seem to have been
made at some stage in the transmission, by
which parallel relations of the same occurrence
are separated and appear as distinct events.
There were evidently considerable differences
in the traditional accounts which the earliest
authors found current. The holy mountain
is in E named Horeb, in J (probably) as in
P, Sinai; Moses' father-in-law in the one is
Jethro, in the other Hobab. In J there are
some traces of a tradition, perhaps the oldest
of all, in which there was no mention of
Sinai; the Israelites made their way straight
from the Red Sea to Kadesh.</p>

<p>A comparison of J and E with the history of
the times of Saul and David in Samuel, and
with the stories of Elijah and Elisha in Kings,
would lead us to ascribe them both to the
classic age of Hebrew prose of which those
narratives are specimens. On the other hand,
in J and the older stratum of E there is no
influence of the prophetic movement of the
eighth century which left so deep a mark on
religion and literature. On these grounds J
may be probably ascribed to the ninth century,
and E, which is somewhat younger, to the
first half of the eighth. Both used older
sources, and both were revised and enlarged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
by later hands; we have had more than one
occasion to refer to an edition of E which
reflects the teaching of the prophets, particularly
of Hosea.</p>

<p>These two histories&mdash;the one, as we have
seen, Judæan, the other Israelite&mdash;ran so
nearly parallel and contained so much matter
in common that an attempt to combine them
in one continuous narrative was natural. The
task was accomplished with considerable skill,
by a Judæan historian in the seventh century,
who probably introduced variants or supplementary
matter from other sources. The
author's own hand is most certainly recognized
in the multiplied and emphasized warnings
against all sorts of heathenism and in a
fine tone of religious reflection on the history
and its lessons, in which the influence of the
prophets is plainly visible, but the peculiar
theories of the seventh century historians
do not appear. Whether this history (JE)
extended beyond the Book of Joshua, and
if so where it ended, are questions which must
be reserved for later consideration.</p>

<p>It is the general opinion that the next stage
in the growth of the Hexateuch (Genesis-Joshua)
was the inclusion in a new edition of
JE of the Book of Deuteronomy in the form
and dimensions which it had attained in the
generation after the fall of Judah; and,
perhaps in connection with this, the history
of the conquest in Joshua as narrated in JE
was recast and much enlarged by an author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
who was full of the ideas and phrases of
Deuteronomy.</p>

<p>At a considerably later time, perhaps in the
fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, or even in the fourth, the
Origins of the Religious Institutions, a product
of the Persian period, with the mass of laws
that had been incorporated in it (see above
p. 57), was united with JED, thus bringing
together into one volume all that was preserved
about the history down to the conquest of
Canaan and all the various institutions and collections
of laws which were attributed to
Moses. The author of this comprehensive
work, as was most natural, took P, with its
sharply marked divisions and outstanding
epochs, as his basis, and introduced in each
period the parts of JE which seemed to him
to belong there. Where P had a parallel
narrative, as in the story of the Flood, he wove
the strands together with more or less ingenuity,
omitting, in ordinary cases, only the most
palpable doublets. It is possible that the
same author first incorporated in P a large
part of the so-called priestly laws; it is more
certain that, besides the harmonistic changes
necessary in combining his sources, he made
numerous additions; but there is usually no
way of distinguishing his hand from that of
earlier or of still later editors.</p>

<p>This hypothesis, which, for all its seeming
complexity, is doubtless a great simplification
of the actual literary history, is accepted by
the majority of Old Testament scholars&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
many variations in particulars, it need
hardly be said. It is commended to the
historian, not merely by the fact that it
explains the confusion and contradiction
which reign in the Pentateuch and offers a
solution of its literary problems, but that,
when the sources are distinguished and reconstructed
and their age and relations determined,
they become historical sources of
great value for the times in which they were
respectively written, confirming, supplementing,
or interpreting the evidence of the historical
books and the prophets, and contributing
important material of various kinds
to our knowledge of civilization in ancient
Israel and of its religious development.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>JOSHUA</h3>


<p>In all the sources of the Pentateuch the possession
of Canaan is the goal toward which the
whole history moves, from the call of Abraham
to the last exhortations of Moses in the plains of
Moab, and they must all have narrated,
however briefly, the occupation of the country.
The history of the conquest and
division of Canaan is the subject of the
Book of Joshua. The author has evidently
derived his material from diverse sources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and it is reasonable to expect to find
among them the continuation of the chief
sources of the Pentateuch. This expectation
is verified; it is not difficult to recognize in
some places the sequel of the preceding
narratives, and other passages which on
internal grounds may confidently be ascribed
to one or the other of them. But the attempt
to analyze the book discovers at once the fact
that the problem is different from that in
Genesis to Numbers. The author of the
Pentateuch had two chief narrative sources,
a history compiled probably in the first half
of the seventh century and in any case pre-Deuteronomic,
which from its two principal
strands is commonly designated by the
symbol JE, and the history of the religious
institutions (P), probably of the fifth century.
The author of Joshua had for his sources,
besides the continuation of P, a history of the
conquest by a writer belonging to what is
not inaptly called the deuteronomist school
of historians, whose thought and style are
moulded by those of Deuteronomy. In cc.
1-12 the author of Joshua follows this source
almost exclusively, only here and there
introducing a passage from the post-exilic
narrative (e.g. Jos. v. 10-12); in cc. 13-24,
on the other hand, the allotment of the tribal
territories and the assignment of cities in
these territories to the levites and the priests,
are chiefly from the later work. Inasmuch
as the style of the deuteronomist and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
priestly writers is characteristically different,
the rough analysis is here comparatively easy,
nor is it ordinarily difficult to recognize the
brief passages which are incorporated from
the older sources; but, as in the Pentateuch,
the discrimination of the original contents
of the priestly source from subsequent
expansions and from the hand of the author
of Joshua himself is frequently very uncertain.
Here also additions were made by editors at a
still later time, some of which are not found
in the Greek version.</p>

<p>A different and much more difficult problem
is presented by Jos. 1-12, the problem, namely,
of the sources of the deuteronomist history.
The duplication of the narrative is very plain
in the story of Jericho (Jos. 6). One account
told how the Israelites marched around the
city once each day for seven days in ominous
silence; on the seventh day, at Joshua's
command, they broke out in the war-cry,
and rushing upon the city from every side,
took it by storm, and put every living thing
in it to the sword, sparing only Rahab
the harlot and her household. In the parallel
narrative a religious procession, the priests
bearing the ark in the midst, compassed the
city seven times; on the last circuit the priests
blew a fanfare on their ram's horns, at which
the walls fell flat to the ground, and the Israelites,
after bringing Rahab to a place of safety,
burnt the city with fire. Editors or scribes
who were particularly edified by the horn-blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
start it prematurely in vs. 8 f., 13,
and have tried to improve on the story in
other places. The second version shows the
same inclination to glorify the divine interventions
by giving them a magical form which
has been remarked in E's account of the
deliverance at the Red Sea, while the simpler
story of the unexpected assault&mdash;to which
there is a close parallel in a Roman hand-book
of military stratagems&mdash;resembles in its
naturalness J's account of the crossing of the
sea.</p>

<p>Both sources tell of the rescue of Rahab,
and thus presuppose some such story as we
find in Jos. 2, where, again, duplication is
evident. The interdict on the spoils of Jericho
(vi. 17, J), is the antecedent to the story of
Achan, whose appropriation of a part of the
spoil is the cause of the repulse at Ai (c. 7),
and thus the clues can be followed backward
and forward. The chief source in c. 8 (the
taking of Ai) and c. 9 (ruse of the Gibeonites)
also is J, with which the parallel account of
E is combined; additions by later hands are
recognizable, the most remarkable being viii.
30-35 (cf. Deut. xxvii. 1-8, 12). In the history
of the two campaigns by which the allied kings
of the south and of the north respectively
were annihilated (Jos. 10 and 11) both sources
appear. A considerable part of these chapters,
however, is the work of the deuteronomist
author, especially the summary of the
conquests, cc. x. 28-43; xi. 10-23. Chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
12, which for completeness goes over the
conquests east of the Jordan also, is dependent
on Deut. 3; Jos. xiii. 2-6 (the territories
remaining to be conquered) is of the same sort
and probably by the same hand.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that both J and E related
the crossing of the Jordan, the taking of Jericho
and the operations against Ai, and, further, the
wars with the confederate kings. In these
narratives Israel, from its standing camp at
Gilgal, invades the country as one great army
under the command of Joshua; the deuteronomist
author represents them as exterminating
the native population root and branch,
"they left not a soul alive." There are,
however, scattered here and there through the
text, fragments of a very different story (xiii.
13; xv. 13-19, 63; xvii. 11-13, 14-18;
xix. 47), most of which are also found continuously
in Judg. 1. According to this account,
the Israelite tribes invaded the country separately
or in small groups; their success varied
in different regions, but everywhere the walled
cities remained in the possession of their old
inhabitants; in some quarters the Israelites
became subject to the Canaanites, in others
they in time reduced them to subjection.
This account may not embody a historical
tradition&mdash;it could perfectly well have arisen
by inference from the actual situation at the
beginning of the kingdom&mdash;but it is at least
in a broad sense historical. The case illustrates
in an instructive way the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
oldest literary sources of the history which
we can recover had themselves diverse and
sometimes contradictory sources in tradition.</p>

<p>In the Pentateuch it is well established that J
and E had been combined by a historian of the
prophetic period (JE), though there is evidence
that the separate works continued to
circulate. In Joshua, also, it is probable that
the deuteronomist historian used the composite
JE, and that the harmonizing of these
sources and some of the religious improvement
which runs along with it is the work
of his predecessor who combined the two
sources. It seems that P also had E independently,
and it is certain that later editors
of the deuteronomist school added their
contributions.</p>

<p>The allotment of the tribal territories, the
designation of asylum cities, and the setting
apart of cities for the levites and priests, comes
chiefly, as was said above, from a priestly
source. How much of it was in the older
history of P (Book of Origins) is doubtful.
One, at least, of the earlier narratives told of
the division of the land by lot, and P, who
followed this representation, may have connected
with it some sort of domesday book;
but it was probably not so detailed as that
which we now read.</p>

<p>The assignment of forty-eight cities to the
priests and levites, including the most important
places in the country, is an extravagance
even for the sacerdotal imagination, comparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to Ezekiel's partition of the land in parallel
strips. It is the counterpart of Num. xxxv.
1-8, in a late supplement to the priestly laws,
and directly contradicts the older principle
(Num. xviii. 21-24) that neither priests nor
levites shall have any landed property. Thus
in Joshua, as in the Pentateuch, the priestly
element is neither of one sort nor of one age:
and again the evidence of the Greek version
shows that additions and changes continued
to be made in the text till the neighbourhood
of 200 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>There is no evidence that the author of our
Book of Joshua was the same as the author
of the present Pentateuch; various indications
point rather to the contrary. Nor can the
author of the deuteronomist history of the
conquest be certainly identified with any one
of the hands engaged in the compilation and
enlargement of the Book of Deuteronomy;
all that can be affirmed is that he was of the
same spirit, and that literary dependence upon
Deuteronomy, and sometimes on younger
parts of it, is visible in many places in Joshua.</p>

<p>The Book of Joshua closes with a farewell
address by Joshua to the tribes of Israel
assembled at Shechem, in which, after a brief
résumé of God's dealing with their fathers
from the calling of Abraham, the exodus, and
their own more recent experiences down to
the present, he exhorts them to put away
the gods which their fathers served "beyond
the river" (in Mesopotamia), and worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Jehovah alone. Thereupon the people
solemnly pledge themselves to serve him only
and hearken to his words (Jos. 24). There
is no question that this discourse is derived
from E; a counterpart to it from the hand of
the author of the deuteronomist Joshua
stands in c. 23, and corresponds to the address
of Moses in Deut. xxxi. 1-8. The sequel of
Jos. xxiv. 28 is found in Judg. ii. 6-9. The
restoration at a late time, of the old fragment
Judg. i. 1-36, and the division of the books at
this point, led to the repetition of the verses
in Jos. xxiv. 29 ff. The importance of this
fact is the proof it gives that E narrated the
history of the generations following the death
of Joshua as an apostasy from the religion of
Jehovah such as the dying leader had warned
the people against (Jos. xxiv. 19), and thus
determined the treatment of the whole period
which we now find in the Book of Judges.
The last injunctions of Joshua in the deuteronomist
history (Jos. xxiii. 14-16) exhibit the
same conception of the subsequent history;
in Judg. ii. 11-iii. 6, both E and the deuteronomist
author are represented.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>JUDGES</h3>


<p>The Book of Judges falls into three parts,
namely, (1) Judg. i. 1-ii. 5, which intrudes, as
has already been observed, between the close
of Joshua and its immediate sequel in Judges
ii. 6 ff.; (2) Judg. ii. 6-xvi. 31, stories of a
succession of champions and deliverers of
Israel in the centuries preceding the establishment
of the kingdom; (3) Judg. 17-18;
19-21, two additional stories laid in the time
of the Judges. In the Christian Bibles the
story of Ruth, which also is said to have
occurred in the days of the Judges, follows.</p>

<p>The introduction, Judg. ii. 6-iii. 6, gives a
summary of the whole period: as soon as
Joshua and his generation had passed away,
the Israelites fell away from the religion of
Jehovah, and worshipped the gods of Canaan;
indignant at this defection, he allowed them
to be overrun and subdued by their enemies;
when in their distress they turned to their own
God for help, he raised them up champions
who delivered them; but their amendment
was brief, they presently relapsed into
heathenism; and so it went on from bad to
worse. In correspondence with this general
scheme each epoch in the history is opened in
some such way as this: The Israelites again
did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he delivered them into the power of such and
such a tyrant or nation; when they cried
unto him, he raised up so and so as a deliverer.
Thereupon follows the story of the deliverance
(see iii. 7-11; iii. 12-15; iv. 1 ff.). Sometimes,
as in vi. 1-10, x. 6-18, these preambles
are expanded, but the purport remains the
same.</p>

<p>Another feature of the book is the systematic
chronology in which the frequency of
the numbers twenty, forty, and eighty (forty
years being in the Old Testament equivalent
to a generation) at once strikes the attention;
see iii. 11, 30; iv. 3; v. 31; viii. 28; xiii.
1; xv. 20 (xvi. 31). In several other instances
the figures vary a little on either side of
twenty (eighteen, twenty-two, etc.). The
duration of the oppression is given in the
introduction of the story; the period of peace
and prosperity which succeeded the deliverance,
at the end; see, e.g., iv. 3; v. 31. In
the same way the life of Moses is divided into
three parts of forty years each; Eli judged
Israel forty years; David and Solomon each
reigned forty years. It can hardly be doubted
that this chronology is artificial, and that the
key to it is found in 1 Kings vi. 1, which
reckons four hundred and eighty years (i.e.
twelve generations) from the exodus to the
building of Solomon's temple; but the actual
figures in Judges and Samuel do not foot up to
this sum, and there are some gaps in the series,
namely, the years of Joshua after the conquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the rule of Samuel, and that of Saul. The
symmetry of the scheme has been broken by
intrusions or accidental omissions in the
later history of the book.</p>

<p>The author of the part of the Book of
Judges we are now considering (ii. 6-xvi.
31) sees in the history of these centuries a
series of "oppressions" by the native kings
or by neighbouring peoples which the Israelites
brought upon themselves by neglecting their
own God and worshipping the deities of the
Canaanites, the Baals and Astartes. This is
making history illustrate and enforce the
prophetic teaching of Hosea in the eighth
century and Jeremiah in the seventh.</p>

<p>About the oppressions the author of Judges
had clearly no information independent of
what he extracted from the stories of the
deliverances in his sources. In accordance
with his theory of national sin and national
disaster he converted what are in the stories
themselves local conflicts, involving particular
tribes or regions, into oppressions and deliverances
of all Israel; where the story tells of
raids by the Midianites, for example, the
introduction gives them the Amalekites and
the Eastern Bedouins for allies, and extends
the devastation these wrought across the
whole country to the neighbourhood of Gaza.
The exaggeration of the evils and the emphasizing
of the moral, as in other cases, invited later
editors to amplifications in the same spirit.
Of the heroes who delivered Israel from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
oppressors the author made a succession of
dictators ("judges"), who differed from the
kings after them chiefly in that their office was
not hereditary, and to most of them he gives
in his chronology a long reign.</p>

<p>The setting of the history is thus unmistakably
a product of the so-called deuteronomist
school of the sixth century which we have
already recognized in Joshua, and shall learn
more of in Kings. The stories themselves
have, however, not been recast or extensively
retouched by deuteronomist hands; only at
the beginning and the end, where they had to
be fitted into the frame, are such retouches
common.</p>

<p>The author's source was a collection of
stories of struggles in different parts of the
land, both east and west of the Jordan, with
the older settled populations or with invaders,
and the exploits of the leaders and champions
of the Israelite tribes in these struggles. It
included Ehud's assassination of the king of
Moab, the defeat of Sisera and the Canaanite
kings of the great Plain by Barak and Deborah,
the rout and pursuit of the Midianite invaders
by Gideon, and Jephthah's victory over the
Ammonites in Gilead. The history of Abimelech's
kingdom of Shechem&mdash;sequel to the
story of Gideon&mdash;which is not accompanied
by the author's moralizing comments, and the
stories of Samson, which have no more than a
chronological introduction and close, evidently
belong to the same cycle of heroic legends;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as do also the stories of Micah's idol and the
migration of the Danites (cc. 17-18), and the
older form of the story of the levite and his
concubine and the sanguinary vengeance on
Benjamin in cc. 19-21. The two last-named
stories were not comprised in the deuteronomist
Judges, whose doctrine they could not
well be made to exemplify. On the other
hand we shall see that this work included Eli
and Samuel among the judges, and came to
its natural conclusion with the establishment
of the kingdom, as it began with the death of
Joshua.</p>

<p>In several of the stories we recognize not
merely such additions and improvements as
are commonly made to popular tales in the
retelling, but evidences of the combination of
two versions of the same exploit or accounts of
other doings of the same hero. This is particularly
plain in the story of Gideon, where in
Judg. vii. 24 f. (vs. 23 is a harmonistic note),
viii. 1-3, the business of the chiefs of Midian
is effectually finished, while in viii. 4 ff. it is
all still to be done. The phenomenon is entirely
similar to those which we have had repeated
occasion to observe in the Pentateuch and
Joshua and is to be explained in the same way.
The two versions of the story had been united
before the time of the author of the deuteronomist
Judges, for in the joints of the narrative
no trace of his peculiar motives or style
occur.</p>

<p>The stories recount the exploits of local or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
tribal heroes, and doubtless represent the
traditions of the regions or tribes concerned;
with the union of the tribes under the kingdom,
however, these traditions became the common
property of the nation, and more than one
writer made collections of them. As in the
patriarchal legends, two strands may be
distinguished, which have such affinities with
the Judæan and the Israelite histories in the
Hexateuch respectively that they are naturally
regarded as the continuations of J and E.
To J may be probably attributed the story of
Ehud (disregarding the introduction and
conclusion), say Judg. iii. 16-28; in the
story of Gideon, viii. 4-60 (with small exceptions),
and a part of cc. 6-7; part of the history
of Abimelech; and the adventures of Samson.
A good specimen of the other narrator is the
beginning of the story of Abimelech, with the
fable of Jotham, Judg. ix. 1-25.</p>

<p>Here, again, additions have been made at
various stages of the transmission: to the
sources independently, by the author who
first combined them, by the deuteronomist
author, and in some places by editors at a
much later time. These hands cannot always
be certainly discriminated, but the main
outlines of the literary history are clear enough.
A peculiar problem is presented by the so-called
Minor Judges, of whom nothing is told
but the length of their rule and the sultanly
size of their families (Judg. x. 1-5; xii. 8-15).
They seem to be brought in only for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the chronology, the difficulties of which
they do not diminish.</p>

<p>Except the curt notices that, the Israelites
having again offended their God, he gave
them into the power of the Philistines for
forty years, and that Samson judged Israel for
twenty years, it has already been remarked
that the stories of Samson have no such introduction
and conclusion as those which precede.
The statement about the duration of Samson's
judgeship occurs both at the end of Judg. 15,
and at the end of c. 16, and it has been inferred
from this that whoever put this formal close
in xv. 20 left out the adventure with Delilah
and Samson's tragic end (c. 16).</p>

<p>The stories of Micah and the migration of
the Danites (Judg. 17-18) and of the levite
and his concubine and the decimation of
Benjamin (cc. 19-21) were not included in the
deuteronomist book; but there is no reason
to doubt that they are of the same age as the
other stories in Judges, nor that they were
found in one or more of the literary collections
of these stories. In cc. 17-18 the character of
the narrative in the main suggests the same
source with the stories of Samson (J), but
there are some duplications and inconsistencies
which may be regarded as fragments of a
closely parallel account of not greatly inferior
age. In cc. 19-21, again, the original story
seems to be from J (with perhaps traces of
another version in c. 19), but in the following
account of the vengeance taken by all Israel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on the Benjamites, the older narrative has
been united with a second, which in its point
of view, its language, and its unimaginable
exaggerations, is evidently akin to parts of the
Books of Chronicles, or to the youngest
additions to the Pentateuch such as the vengeance
on the Midianites (Num. 31), and
doubtless belongs to the most recent stratum
of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Judges i. 1-ii. 5, as has been pointed out
above, is foreign to the connection in which it
stands, and can only have been introduced
there by a late compiler or editor. It is a
remnant of the most historical, and presumably
the oldest, account of the establishment of the
tribes in western Palestine. That, in completer
form, it had originally a place in the
Judæan history (J) is unquestioned, and in
that work it may have been closely followed
by stories of exploits such as those of Ehud,
Barak, Gideon. Inasmuch as it contradicted
the theory of the complete conquest and
extermination of the Canaanites, it was left
out of the works which described the conquest
in that way, but scraps of it were subsequently
introduced in Joshua, and finally the whole
restored in its present position. It is easily
seen that the recurring apostasies into
Canaanite heathenism, as well as such stories
as those of Deborah and Barak and of Abimelech,
assume that the Canaanites had not been
killed off to the last man, but, on the contrary,
were very much alive; and, in fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
authors of Judg. ii. 20-iii. 4 feel the necessity
of explaining why God had allowed these
heathen to survive.</p>

<p>The historical value of the stories in Judges
is very great. However large the element of
legendary embellishment may be in them, they
give us a picture of the social and religious
conditions in the period preceding the founding
of the kingdom which has an altogether different
reality from the narratives of the exodus
and the wanderings.</p>

<p>The trustworthiness of this picture is confirmed
by one contemporary monument of
prime significance, the triumphal ode in Judg.
5, commonly called the Song of Deborah,
celebrating the victory of the Israelite tribes
over Sisera and his hosts and the death of the
fleeing king by the hand of a Bedouin woman
in whose tent he sought refuge. The text in
the middle of the poem has suffered greatly,
but the beginning and end are better preserved
and display not only a developed poetic art
but poetic inspiration of the highest kind.
To the historian it has an even greater interest
for the light which it throws on the times:
the independence of the tribes on both sides
of the Jordan, the subjection of those along
the Great Plain to the Canaanite kings with
their walled cities and their formidable chariotry,
the summons to the struggle in the name
of religion and the varying response, the victory
of Jehovah over his foes. It should
not be overlooked that Judah is ignored;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it was not counted among the tribes of
Israel.</p>

<p>The moralizing improvement of the history
in the Book of Judges is not carried beyond the
story of Jephthah, but neither at that point
nor after the stories of Samson is there anything
to indicate that the author is done. The
introduction in Judg. ii. 11-iii. 6, a passage
in which both the deuteronomist historian and
a predecessor in the same way of thinking
have had a hand, seems to require a correspondingly
solemn conclusion, and the example
of Deuteronomy and Joshua suggests that this
would take the form of a hortatory address
such as Moses and Joshua deliver as their
testament to the people. Exactly such a
discourse is found in 1 Sam. 12, where the
aged Samuel, on the point of laying down his
office as judge, reminds the people's conscience
of the chief crises of the times of the judges
in terms reminiscent of the introduction to the
Book of Judges and to the several oppressions,
upbraids them for their sin in desiring a king,
and closes with admonitions for the future.
Here Samuel appears as a judge, the last in
the succession; as a judge he is represented
also in 1 Sam. 7, where he delivers his people
from the Philistines in the great victory at
Ebenezer through the efficacy of his sacrifice
and prayers&mdash;a Gideon or a Jephthah went
about the business in a more secular fashion!
Eli also is said to have judged Israel forty
years. At some stage in the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sources of Judges and Samuel, therefore,
Eli and Samuel were enumerated among the
judges, and the close of the period was marked
by the address of Samuel which we now read
in 1 Sam. 12. The contents and form of this
address have their parallels in the writings of
the sixth century or the latter part of the
seventh, and to that time it is doubtless to be
ascribed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>SAMUEL</h3>


<p>A different division is adopted in the present
books of Judges and Samuel, in which the
stories of Eli and of Samuel are not made the
close of the period of the judges but the
prelude to the history of the kingdom. The
Greek Bible divides this history into four
books of the Kingdoms, or rather of the Reigns
of the Kings; the Hebrew, into two, Samuel
and Kings; the modern translations employ
the latter names but adopt the subdivisions
of the Greek, thus making two books of Samuel
and two of Kings. First Samuel shows how the
conquest and occupation of central Palestine
by the Philistines led to the establishment of
a national kingdom under Saul, a Benjamite;
narrates the rise of his rival, the Judæan
David, and the feud between them, down to
the disastrous battle with the Philistines at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Mt. Gilboa in which Saul and his gallant sons
fell. Second Samuel is the history of David's
reign and the tragedy of his house, the conclusion
of which, the intrigue which raised
Solomon to the throne and the death of the
aged king, is treated as the prelude to Solomon's
reign and carried over into 1 Kings; one
recension of the Greek Bible, however, joins
these chapters (1 Kings 1-2) to the preceding
book. The two Books of Kings recount the
reign of Solomon; the division of the kingdom
after his death into two, on the old line, Israel
and Judah; the parallel history of the two
kingdoms to the end of Israel in 721 <small>B.C.</small>;
and the rest of the history of Judah to its fall
in 586.</p>

<p>In the account of how Saul became king
there are two contradictory representations.
One of these, which agrees with 1 Sam. 12 in
treating the desire of the people for a king
as the wanton repudiation of Jehovah their
king and of Samuel their divinely appointed
judge, is contained in cc. 8; x. 17-27; 12.
The other, according to which God, seeing the
distress the people were in because of the
Philistines, of his own motion resolves to give
them a king to deliver them from their
oppressors, is in 1 Sam. ix. 1-x. 16; 11.
In c. 9 Samuel appears as a seer with a neighbourhood
reputation of being able to tell
where people's stray asses have gone, not as
the prophet and judge, the first man of his
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>These strands can be followed in both directions
beyond the chapters named: 1 Sam. xiii.
1-xiv. 66 belongs to the second, which we may
call the national version of the matter; c. 15
attaches itself to the other, say theocratic, representation,
though it is of a somewhat
different texture. On the other side, vii.
3-17 plainly goes with c. 8; while iv. 1<small><sup>b</sup></small>-vii.
2 are akin to the national version, showing
how grievous the situation was and how
urgent the need of a king. Chapters 1-3
have a twofold motive; they tell of the
wonderful childhood of a great man, and
they explain the disasters of Eli's house. The
latter has reference to cc. 4-6; the former,
a favourite theme of popular tales, is
an appropriate introduction to Samuel the
prophet.</p>

<p>Of the two accounts of the origin of the kingdom,
it takes no great critical discernment to
see that what we have called the national
version is the older and more historical; the
other, which condemns the monarchy as a
kind of apostasy, takes the standpoint of
Hosea. The picture of the monarch in 1 Sam.
12 is drawn from sorry experience.</p>

<p>Even in the older narrative not all is of one
piece. Chapter 9, in which Saul is a young
man in his father's house, does not tally
with c. 14, where he has a grown-up son.
The author of this narrative made it up from
traditions of diverse origin, some of them
more strictly historical, others embellished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with legendary traits. In its main features,
however, it gives us a trustworthy account
of the establishment of the kingdom. In c.
13, the breach with Samuel, vs. 7<small><sup>b</sup></small>-15<small><sup>a</sup></small> (with
x. 8 which prepares for it), are not part of
the original narrative; c. 15 gives another
account of the origin of this breach, which
was evidently a standing feature of tradition.
In the remaining chapters of 1 Samuel the
central interest is the relations of David to
Saul. Here also there are not only two main
literary sources but evidence of variant
traditions underlying the oldest narrative,
and of the additions by later editors, sometimes
of their conception, sometimes taken
from old and good sources.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to pursue the analysis
of the sources further. It must suffice to say
that the further on we go, the more the older
and better of the histories predominates.
In 2 Samuel almost the whole is from this
source (c. 7 is a notable exception, in the
spirit and manner of the seventh century).
Abridgment and transposition have brought
matters into disorder at some points; but
2 Sam. 9-20 is a well-preserved piece of continuous
narrative, of which 1 Kings 1-2 is the
sequel. 2 Sam. xxi. 1-14 and c. 24 are from
the same source, but must originally have
stood at an earlier point in the history;
their present position is best explained by
supposing that they were once omitted&mdash;which
their contents make very natural&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
subsequently restored from a completer
copy, not in their proper connection but in
an appendix. Chapter xxiii. 8-39 is a very
ancient roster of David's "valiant men,"
the companions of his days as an outlawed
freebooter on the Philistine border; xxi.
15-22 is of the same character. Two poems
attributed to David are also included in this
appendix, c. 22, which, with many variants,
is found also in the Psalter (Ps. 18), and xxiii.
1-7.</p>

<p>The history of Saul and David gave little
invitation to a moralizing improvement such
as we have found in Judges and shall find again
in Kings. Whatever faults those heroes had,
a propensity to the worship of heathen gods
could not be laid to them. The national
uprising against the Philistines was, in fact,
a revival of religion. If in times of peace
men sought the blessing of the gods of the
soil (the Baals) upon their tillage, in war
their only reliance was on Jehovah, the god of
Israel. Nor was the worship of Jehovah at
the village sanctuaries (high places) or upon
altars erected for the nonce, illegitimate, even
in deuteronomic theory, till God had taken
up his sole abode in Solomon's temple.
Accordingly there is, after 1 Sam. 12, once the
close of a history of the judges, small trace of
the motives or phrases of the seventh-century
school of historians; and only in a few
passages can the hand of post-exilic editors
be suspected. For the rest we have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
our hands a product of the oldest Hebrew
historiography.</p>

<p>From a literary point of view the older
source in the history of David is unsurpassed.
It has in perfection all the qualities that
distinguish the best Hebrew prose such as
are conspicuous in the Judæan author of the
patriarchal stories in Genesis. In the art
of narrative Herodotus himself could do
no better.</p>

<p>Its historical value is also very high. The
account of David's later years in 2 Sam. 9-20;
2 Kings 1-2 bears all the marks of contemporary
origin. It comes from one who not only
knew the large political events of the reign,
but was intimately informed about the life
of the court, and the scandals, crimes, and
intrigues in the king's household which clouded
the end of his glorious career. These things
are narrated with an objectivity and impartiality
which cannot fail to impress the reader.
The author has a high admiration for David,
but this does not lead him to gloze over his
faults or even his grave sins, nor to disguise
the weakness of his rule in his own house
which was the cause of so much unhappiness.
His development of this domestic tragedy
is, indeed, truly dramatic, and the discrimination
of the characters&mdash;say of Absalom
and Adonijah&mdash;shows fine insight. He tells
without comment how only the distrust of
some of the Philistine chiefs kept David,
as a vassal of Achish of Gath, from fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
upon the Philistine side against Saul in the
fatal battle of Mt. Gilboa. So, too, he is
loyally minded to Solomon, but he does not
conceal the strings of the harem-intrigue by
which the doting old King David was brought
to declare for his succession, or to pass over
the ominous beginning of Solomon's "new
course," with the execution of Adonijah, the
deposition of the priest Abiathar, and the
murder, at altar where he had sought asylum,
of Joab, to whom more than any other the
house of Jesse owed the throne. The official
pretexts are duly recorded, but the facts
speak for themselves. In 1 Kings ii. 5 f. the
death of Joab is enjoined in David's testament;
opinions differ whether these verses are
from the same source with ii. 12 ff., or are
by the late seventh-century writer to whom
vs. 1-4 are ascribed by all. Without idealizing
David, we may at least allow ourselves
the conjecture that, if his last words decided
the death of his old companion in arms and
most loyal servant, Nathan or Bathsheba
was at his dying ear.</p>

<p>The crisis in the history of the Israelite
tribes which the Philistine invasion created;
the long struggle with these foes, very different
from their conflicts with their petty neighbours;
the emergence in this struggle of a
national consciousness at once political and
religious; the union of the tribes in a national
kingdom; the conquest of independence; the
following wars of expansion and the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of a short-lived Israelite empire&mdash;these
were achievements to stir the soul of a people
and be celebrated in song and story. The
leaders too, in these memorable doings were
such heroes as ancient history loves to have
in the middle of its stage&mdash;Saul with his
chivalric son Jonathan; David with Joab,
Abner, and the rest of his gallant band.</p>

<p>The making of great history has often given
a first impulse to the writing of history, and
we may well believe that it was so in Israel,
and that the beginning of Hebrew historical
literature, in the proper sense of the word,
was made with Saul and David. Around
such figures the popular imagination always
weaves a more or less translucent tissue of
legend, and particularly about their youth
before they come out on the stage of history,
or the manner of their first appearance.</p>

<p>The historians gathered up tribal tales
such as the exploits of the judges (that is,
in the original sense, deliverers, or defenders),
the sacred legends of holy places, the traditions
of a wonderful escape from the Egyptians,
a visit to the Mount of God and an agreement
to worship the god of the place as their god,
of another sanctuary in the desert at Kadesh,
conflicts with the Bedouins, and attempts to
force an entry into Canaan&mdash;in short, all the
diverse material which is preserved in the
older narratives in Exodus and Numbers&mdash;and
combined them as best they could into a
continuous history of the people of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>The continuity is, however, only a narrative
continuity; historically there are great gaps
in it, or, more exactly, the traditions cluster
about only a few points, such as the exodus
and the invasion of Palestine, and these
are embellished with a wealth of legendary
and mythical circumstance beneath which
the facts are effectually hidden. The nature
of this material may be judged from the fact
that between Joshua and Eli there are only
the episodes of the judges, strung on a chronological
string, generalized as experiences
of all Israel, and put under a theological
judgment&mdash;invaluable as pictures of civilization,
but as a history of a couple of centuries
(the chronology says four) evidently insufficient.
On the other side of the exodus are,
according to the genealogies, three or four
generations (the chronology again makes it
four hundred years) of total ignorance;
beyond that lies the patriarchal story, the
realm of pure legend.</p>

<p>Out of such materials Judæan authors in
the tenth and following centuries constructed
the history of their people from the remotest
antiquity, and, as commonly happens with
the first precipitation of national traditions,
preformed all subsequent representations.</p>

<p>This earliest book of history is commonly
designated in the Pentateuch and Joshua by
the symbol J. It is disputed whether the
oldest history of the founding of the kingdom
in Samuel should be regarded as a continuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of J. If it were meant thereby to affirm
unity of authorship of this strand from
Genesis to Samuel, that would be saying
much more than the facts warrant; but there
is through the whole so noteworthy a congruity
of conception and sameness of excellence in
style that it is not inappropriate to use for
it the one symbol J in the sense of the oldest
Judæan history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>KINGS</h3>


<p>David took Jerusalem, which till then had
been a Jebusite stronghold, and made it the
capital of his kingdom; but he reigned,
after as before, in patriarchal fashion, making,
so far as appears, few changes in the old
institutions. Solomon reorganized the monarchy
after the common pattern of Oriental
despotisms, dividing the country into provinces
for purposes of taxation, without
regard to the autonomy of the tribes and their
liberties. He built a great palace in the
citadel, and, within the same enclosure, a
temple, which, as the royal sanctuary, was
also in a sense national. Like other Eastern
rulers, he caused his doings to be recorded
in the annals of the kingdom, and doubtless
the priests of the temple kept their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
chronicles. From this time, therefore, sources
of a new kind make their appearance in the
history, contemporary records drawn from
the royal and priestly annals. The extracts
from these sources in the Book of Kings, like
those of the Assyrian kings, or the Ph&oelig;nician
annals of which fragments (through Menander)
are preserved by Josephus, were brief and bald
records of doings or happenings, not biographical
or historical narratives. But brief
and bald as they were they furnished a
groundwork of fact; and, since they set down
at the accession of each king the length of his
predecessor's reign, they gave also the data
for a continuous chronology.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the historical
literature whose brilliant beginnings we have
seen ceased in the first century of the kingdom
or that the writers occupied themselves solely
with the remoter past. The memorable deeds
of great men will not have gone uncelebrated.
The narrative, however, which is the chief
source for the times of Saul and David, breaks
off abruptly in 1 Kings 2. The Books of
Kings are of a wholly different fabric. For
one thing, while the two Books of Samuel
cover little more than the span of one long
lifetime, Kings, in about the same space,
comprises the history of close on to four
centuries. But there is a still greater difference,
as we shall see, in the way in which
history is treated.</p>

<p>The grand divisions of the Books of Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
are these: 1 Kings ii. 12-xi. 43 is occupied
with the reign of Solomon; the division of
the kingdom after his death is narrated in
xii. 1-24; the parallel history of the two
kingdoms of Israel and Judah to the fall of
Samaria in 721 <small>B.C.</small> runs to 2 Kings xviii. 12;
the history of Judah from that date to its
own fall in 586 fills the rest of the book.</p>

<p>The age of the book is easily determined:
it tells of the two sieges of Jerusalem by the
Babylonians (597 and 586 <small>B.C.</small>); the destruction
of the temple and palace and the razing
of the city walls, the assassination of Gedaliah,
whom Nebuchadnezzar had made governor
over the devastated land; and the flight
of the Jews from the king's vengeance to
Egypt. The last event mentioned is the
liberation of King Jehoiachin by Evil-Merodach
(Amil-Marduk) in 561 <small>B.C.</small> It is of
course possible that this detached notice
(2 Kings xxv. 27-30) was added by a later
hand; but there is no reason to include the
story of Gedaliah in this suspicion. The
book in its present form cannot, therefore,
be earlier than, say, about 580 <small>B.C.</small> In some
places in the body of the book, also, the fall
of Judah is spoken of as an accomplished
fact, e.g. 2 Kings xvii. 19 f. (in conflict with
vss. 18 and 21 ff.). Such passages are, however,
not very numerous, and they commonly sit
loose in their context, like the verses just
cited, as if they were thrust into the narrative
by an editor. The bulk of the work, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
contrary, seems to suppose the existence of
the kingdom. It is, therefore, the general
opinion that the book was written before the
fall of Jerusalem, and that a continuator
added the account of the catastrophe and
the events immediately subsequent to it.</p>

<p>The older Kings, from beginning to end,
is dominated by the conception and permeated
by the phraseology of Deuteronomy and of
the prophet Jeremiah, and must therefore
be placed between 621 <small>B.C.</small> (the date of the
introduction of the deuteronomic law) and
the beginning of the last act of the history,
that is to say, probably shortly before the
year 600 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>It is not enough to say that Kings was
written under the influence of Deuteronomy;
it was written, we might rather say, as a
commentary on the deuteronomic doctrine
that falling away from the national religion
is punished by national disaster. In this
point of view it resembles Judges; but while
in Judges it is the lapse into Canaanite
heathenism, the worship of the Baals and
Astartes, which draws upon Israel invasion
and subjugation, in Kings not only foreign
religions but the worship at the high places,
that is, the worship of Jehovah at his oldest
and holiest sanctuaries, provokes the wrath
of God; for since the dedication of Solomon's
temple Jehovah had made it his exclusive
abode and all other places of worship were
illegitimate. We have seen that down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Josiah's reform this worship prevailed unchallenged
in both kingdoms. In the author's
view, generation after generation, under bad
kings and good, had thus sinned against the
organic law of religion, and all judgments
had failed to work amendment. In Israel
idolatry made the case worse; the "golden
calves," that is, the small images of Jehovah
in the form of a bull, which Jeroboam had set
up at Bethel and Dan, were worshipped under
all his successors. These sins had in the end
brought ruin on Israel, and they were bringing
it on Judah. Manasseh had done even
worse than Jeroboam; strange gods from
near and far were installed in the temple
itself, and under its walls men sacrificed their
children to "the King" (Moloch). Josiah's
reforms had no lasting results; the reaction
under his successors restored the high places,
and heathen cults flourished again. The
doom was imminent; would Judah learn
the lesson of history before it was too late?
Some one has said that history is philosophy
teaching by example; for the author of
Kings history was prophecy teaching by
example.</p>

<p>It was the lesson of the history that the
author was after, and this ruling motive
determined his selection of material as well
as the treatment of it. It explains why he
hardly tells anything about some of the
greatest kings and the most glorious periods
of the history, which did not afford illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of his thesis, while he dwells on things
of much less historical importance.</p>

<p>The characteristic interests of the author
and his highly characteristic style sharply
distinguish his own writing from the sources
which he incorporates. These sources, as
will be supposed, were of different kinds and
of various worth; they were naturally not
the same in all parts of the long period he
covers, and he has not always dealt with them
in the same way. Part of his material comes,
directly or indirectly, from the annals of the
kings, to which the reader is regularly referred
for further information (see e.g., 1 Kings xiv.
19, 29), or from temple records; part of it
from more properly literary sources. Sometimes
it has all the marks of trustworthy
tradition originating close to the event;
again, it is embroidered with legendary
traits; a smaller part is edifying fiction.
In some cases, as in the stories of Elijah and
Elisha, a special source is recognizable, but
in the main the attempt to trace the literary
channels through which the matter reached
the author is fruitless.</p>

<p>In the history of Solomon's reign the
central place is taken by a description of the
palace and temple he erected (1 Kings 6-7),
for which c. 5 is a preparation, and c. 8, the
dedication of the temple, the sequel. The
interesting account of the provincial organization
and system of taxation in c. 4 is evidently
from an authoritative source; the cession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of cities in Galilee to Hiram, the list of cities
fortified, the (mutilated) account of the revolt
of Edom, the rise of the kingdom of Damascus,
and the (mutilated) history of the revolt of
Jeroboam, the prelude to the separation of
Israel and Judah, are also of good authority.</p>

<p>By the side of these are stories celebrating
the magnificence and wisdom of Solomon,
the beginnings of the exuberant Solomonic
legend. The judgment of Solomon in the
case of the two harlots and of the visit of the
Queen of Sheba are examples of the popular
tale, and relatively old. The dedication
of the temple has been much expanded by
the author of the Book of Kings; 1 Kings
viii. 14-66 are wholly his composition; ix.
1-9 is an appendix to c. 8. In viii. 1-12 an
older account of the dedication has been
improved by various hands. Comparison
with the Greek translation shows that this
process went on to very late times; the latest
additions are akin to the priestly stratum
in the Pentateuch. Chapter xi. 1-13 also
is by the author of the Book of Kings, built
about a few words from his source in vs. 7;
vss. 29-40 are of the same sort.</p>

<p>1 Kings 12-2 Kings 17 contains the parallel
history of Israel and Judah. The method
of the author is to follow the reign of a king,
say of Israel, to its end and then go back to
take up the king of Judah who came to the
throne during this reign, follow him to his
death, and return to pick up the Israelite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
history again in the same way. The result
is, thus, interlocking histories, rather than a
parallel history. The length of each reign
is given, probably ultimately from the annals,
with a computed synchronism which is at
some points demonstrably in error. With
the introduction of each king a comprehensive
judgment by the standard of the deuteronomic
law is pronounced upon his reign. Thus,
"In the eighteenth year of the king Jeroboam
the son of Nebat [king of Israel], began
Abijah to reign over Judah. Three years
reigned he in Jerusalem, and his mother's
name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
And he walked in all the sins of his father
which he had done before him," etc. "In
the third year of Asa king of Judah began
Baasha the son of Abijah to reign over all
Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned twenty and
four years. And he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the
way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith
he made Israel to sin." These judgments
are so stereotyped that they are pronounced
even on kings who reigned but a short time&mdash;Zimri,
for instance, who lasted only seven
days. In the case of godly kings of Judah,
even of such as are credited with commendable
zeal against the worships that Deuteronomy
denounces as Canaanitish heathenism, the
reproach of leaving the worship of Jehovah
at the "high places" unmolested is not spared
them; see, e.g., 1 Kings xv. 1-14; xxii. 43.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>The conflict between the tribes to whom
the name Israel by historical right belonged,
headed by Ephraim, intent on reclaiming
the ancient liberties which Solomon had
curtailed and securing adequate guarantees
for them, and Rehoboam, obstinate to maintain
the despotism which his father had
established and the supremacy of Judah,
ended in the Israelite tribes refusing to
acknowledge the succession and setting up a
kingdom of their own with Jeroboam the son
Nebat as king. These critical events are
narrated in the source, 1 Kings xii. 1-20, with
noteworthy impartiality; a comparison with
the treatment of the matter by the author of
the Book of Kings himself in xi. 29-39;
xii. 21-24, is instructive. The account of
Jeroboam's religious foundations and innovations
in c. xii. 26-33 (with which xiii. 33<small><sup>b</sup></small>
belongs) is probably based on an old Israelite
source (the temples Jeroboam built, etc.), on
which the author of the book has put his own
construction and made his own comments.
1 Kings 13 is a specimen of the edifying
stories&mdash;religious fiction&mdash;which were added
to the historical books at a very late time
and are especially numerous in Chronicles;
the reference to it in 2 Kings xxiii. 17 f. is an
interpolation in a context itself post-exilic.
The story of the visit of Jeroboam's wife
to the prophet Ahijah (1 Kings xiv. 1-18)
is in the manner of the author, but seems to
have an older basis. The fluid state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
text at a very late time is again shown by
the fact that in some recensions of the Greek
version the story is not found in this place,
but, together with other matter about Jeroboam
(in part variant parallel to 1 Kings xi.
26 ff., 40), in a long passage which stands
in c. 12 between vss. 24 and 25.</p>

<p>The invasion of Shishak, king of Egypt
(1 Kings xiv. 25-28), is introduced by the
author with a catalogue of the deuteronomic
transgressions which provoked God to punish
the kingdom in this way; the similarity to
the introduction to the oppressions in Judges
is apparent. So in the following chapters:
the author's facts probably come from annalistic
sources which can in places be recognized,
but the religious interpretation of the events,
which he sometimes gives in his own quality
as historian, sometimes puts into the mouth
of a prophet (e.g. xvi. 1-7, cf. xiv. 1-18), is
from the point of view of the deuteronomist
school.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the author's
method is illustrated by his treatment of the
reign of Omri (1 Kings xvi. 23-28). Omri was
the founder of the greatest dynasty of the
northern kingdom, and was one of its greatest
kings. From an inscription of the Moabite
king Mesha, we learn that Omri subjugated
the lands east of the Jordan (see also 2 Kings i.
1; iii. 4 ff.), and it is probable that his conquests
were pushed to the north-east into
Syria; the Assyrian kings long after his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
call Israel the "house of Omri." But the
long and brilliantly successful reign of a
king who in religion followed in the footsteps
of the kings of Israel before him, "golden
calves" and all, obviously could not be
made to exemplify the doctrine that such sins
are regularly visited by condign judgment
in national disaster. Consequently, all that
our author records of Omri, beyond the
revolutions which paved for him the way to
the throne (1 Kings xvi. 16-18), is contained
in one verse, 1 Kings xvi. 24&mdash;he built a capital
on a new site, Samaria!</p>

<p>In the following reign, however, Israel had
troubles enough; the conquests east of the
Jordan were lost, and the long chapter of
Syrian wars began. This was material more
to the author's purpose, and he makes good
use of it. Here also, in addition to the annals
and whatever other sources were at his hand
for the preceding period, he had a new and
peculiarly grateful source in the stories of
Elijah and Elisha. To the fact that these
prophets were outstanding figures in some
of the crises of the Syrian wars we owe it
that so much of the history of that struggle
is preserved; for what the author has extracted
from the annals is as meagre as
elsewhere.</p>

<p>From such "lives and times" of the
prophets is derived much the greater part of
1 Kings 17-2 Kings 10, with 2 Kings xiii. 14-21.
The stories of Elijah (1 Kings 17-19; 21;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
2 Kings 1; ii. 1-18) are among the most
striking in the Old Testament; the supernatural
in them seems the natural setting
for a figure of such heroic mould, and is a
stronger testimony than any record of fact
could be to the impression of the superman
on the imagination of ordinary mortals.
Through the vesture of legend, we too have
the impression of a something titanic in the
man who dared solitary to stand for his God
against kings, priests, prophets, and people,
and, worse than all, the vengeful fury of a
woman! We can see, also, that his conflict
against the prophets of Baal makes an era
in the history of religion in Israel. "If
Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal,
then follow him," he thunders at the people
on Mt. Carmel. It was not the first assertion
of the jealousy of Jehovah and the exclusiveness
of the true religion; but the issue had
never before been so dramatically joined.
The intolerant monotheism of Judaism had
found its war cry.</p>

<p>1 Kings 17-19, Elijah at Sarepta, on Carmel,
and at Horeb, belong together; the beginning,
which must in some way have brought Elijah
upon the stage, is not preserved; 1 Kings 21
(Naboth's vineyard) may very well be from
the same source; in the end of the chapter
(vs. 20<small><sup>b</sup></small>-26) the author of the Book of Kings
has the word, and in the other chapters there
are slight traces of the same hand. With
these small exceptions the stories are old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and probably received their present literary
form in the ninth century, certainly before
the prophetic movement of the eighth.
2 Kings i. 2-17 is a legend of a different kind
and presumably considerably younger. 2
Kings ii. 1-18, on the other hand, is akin
to the older stories in 1 Kings 17-19, 21;
it forms the connecting link with Elisha.</p>

<p>Among the stories of Elijah stand other
episodes of the Syrian wars in which prophets
figure, 1 Kings 20; xxii. 1-38. The second of
these, Micaiah ben Imlah before Ahab and
Jehoshaphat, is of peculiar interest. They
are apparently of the same age with their
surroundings. In both a few verses are from
later editors. To the same cycle probably
belong 2 Kings iii. 4-27, the campaign against
Moab, as well as 2 Kings ix. 1-x. 27, Jehu's
revolt instigated by Elisha, the murder of King
Ahaziah and of the queen mother, Jezebel,
the massacre of the princes of the house of
Omri and the extirpation of the worship of
Baal.</p>

<p>Beside these are a group of stories about
Elisha, chiefly celebrating him as a wonder-worker,
and bringing him into connection
with the "sons of the prophets," who seem
to have formed a kind of dervish order. The
collector or editor has accumulated them all
in one reign, probably against their original
intention. Scattered through the narratives
drawn from the lives of the prophets are brief
notices from the annals and the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
deuteronomist appraisals by the author of
Kings.</p>

<p>The attempt of Jehu to exterminate the
dynasty of Omri, involving the slaughter of
the Judæan princes, had the unintended result
of enabling the queen mother, Athaliah, a
daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, to seize the
throne. The revolution, planned by the chief
priest of Jerusalem, which overthrew the
usurper and brought the true heir, the seven-year-old
Joash, to his own, is told in 2 Kings
xi. 1-20; a somewhat minute account of the
restoration of the temple in his reign follows
in c. xii. 4-16, both from a good Judæan
source, perhaps ultimately a temple chronicle.
The author of Kings has his usual formulas,
including the tolerated high places, in c.
xii. 1-3. The extract from the annals at the
end of the chapter, the straits into which
Hazael of Syria brought Joash, and his death
by a treasonable conspiracy, which might be
thought to prove that piety is not always
crowned with prosperity, is anticipated by the
author of Kings in 2 Kings xii. 3&mdash;Joash's piety
lasted only as long as he was in the leading
strings of the priest Jehoiada.</p>

<p>In the following reigns the material derived
from narrative sources is more scanty; a
noteworthy passage of this kind is the account,
evidently from an Israelite writer, of the
chastisement Jehoash of Israel inflicted on the
presumptuous Amaziah of Judah (2 Kings
xiv. 8-14). The contemporary reigns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Jeroboam II of Israel and Azariah, or Uzziah,
of Judah, lasting half a century, a period
of great prosperity in both kingdoms, are
dispatched with extreme brevity, and are
followed by the swiftly successive conspiracies
and revolutions in which the northern kingdom
declined to its fall. The story of treason and
bloodshed is suspended to tell of the reign of
Ahaz in Judah (2 Kings 16) from a source
chiefly interested in the temple, and then the
last act of Israel's tragedy opens. To the
brief account of the fall of Samaria in 2 Kings
xvii. 1-6, is appended the moral of the whole
history, <span class="smcap">vss.</span> 7-41. This homiletic improvement
of the catastrophe was an inviting task,
and besides the author of Kings, the exilian
continuator and perhaps still later editors
contributed to draw it out and emphasize it.</p>

<p>From this point the historian has only
Judah to deal with. The reign of Hezekiah
is narrated at some length in 2 Kings 18-20.
A considerable part of these chapters (xviii.
13-xx. 19) is found also in the Book of Isaiah
(Isa. 36-39), with variations which are of
much interest for the history of the text.
The psalm, Isa. xxxviii. 9-20, for instance, is
not found in Kings; 2 Kings xviii. 14-16 is
not in Isaiah, and minor differences occur in
almost every verse. The introduction to the
reign of Hezekiah by the author of Kings is
somewhat longer than usual, and attributes
to him not only the destruction of the serpent
idol in the temple which Moses was believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to have made (cf. Num. xxi. 8 f.), and of other
apparatus of heathenism, but the removal of
the high places, making him thus anticipate
the reforms of Josiah a century later (2 Kings
xviii. 4). This probably exaggerates Hezekiah's
good works, but for the bronze serpent
to which sacrificial worship had been paid
from time immemorial, as well as for vs. 7 f.
(Hezekiah's rebellion), which is the antecedent
of vs. 13 ff., he may have had the authority
of the annals.</p>

<p>From the annals probably come also 2 Kings
xviii. 13-16, with their brief record of the penalty
Hezekiah paid for his revolt. Of this we
have also Sennacherib's account in his inscriptions,
where he tells how he took the cities of
Judah and shut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem
"like a bird in a cage," and gives the figures
of the heavy indemnity he imposed upon him.
There follow two longer accounts of Sennacherib's
operations, 2 Kings xviii. 17-xix.
8 and xix. 9-37, which are commonly regarded
as parallel and somewhat discrepant relations
of the same campaign, but by some are thought
to refer to two different occasions, at an
interval of ten years or more. 2 Kings xx.
1-11 (cf. Isa. 38) is perhaps from a life of
Isaiah, who is the chief figure in it; vs. 12-19
(Isa. 39), the embassy of the chronic Babylonia
rebel, Merodach Baladan, presumably to
undermine Hezekiah's shaky loyalty to his
Assyrian lord, seems to belong at an earlier
point in the story; in it also Isaiah is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
central person. In the closing paragraph the
author of Kings has preserved an interesting
annalistic notice of an aqueduct and reservoir
which Hezekiah constructed, not improbably
the Siloam tunnel and the reservoir it feeds.</p>

<p>Of the fifty-five years' reign of Manasseh,
and the two years of his son Amon, a half-century
of peace and prosperity in which
the country recuperated from the disasters
Hezekiah had brought upon it, nothing is told.
Instead we have a long catalogue of Manasseh's
religious obliquities, which includes all the
crimes most abhorrent to the seventh-century
prophets and laws, and the proclamation of
God "by his servants the prophets" that
these sins sealed the doom of Judah. This
prediction is made from the standpoint of the
accomplished fact, and indeed most of the
chapter seems to be by the exilian continuator
of Kings or a still later writer.</p>

<p>With the reforms of Josiah (621 <small>B.C.</small>; 2
Kings 22-23) we arrive at events which, if not
within the personal knowledge of the author
of Kings, were known to his older contemporaries.
This does not, of course, exclude
the use of written records or narratives, and,
in fact, there seem to be traces of such in the
chapters. More certain it is that the continuator
of the book made some changes in the
account; the oracle of Huldah, for example,
seems to have been revised in the light of the
event.</p>

<p>To this continuator, as has already been said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the history of the two sieges of Jerusalem,
the deportations, and the misfortunes of those
who were left in the land are to be attributed.
In several places in earlier parts of the history
we have had occasion to observe that additions
and changes continue to be made by
the editors or scribes&mdash;and every scribe who
copied a book in those days wielded an
editor's pen when he chose&mdash;until a time close
to the age of the Greek translation, that is,
the third century <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The age in which the Pentateuch and the
several Historical Books (Joshua-Kings), the
product of the long and obscure process which
we have attempted to outline in the preceding
chapters, were adjusted and connected so as
to make a continuous history from the creation
to the fall of the Judæan state, can be fixed
only by the fact that the author of Chronicles
(about 300 <small>B.C.</small> or somewhat later; see
below) seems to have read these books in the
order and, so far as his use of them permits a
judgment, substantially with the contents of
our present Old Testament. This arrangement,
or edition, if we choose to call it so, as
has been shown, did not put an end to additions
and alterations, though they gradually
became less frequent and less important in the
following centuries. A standard and stable
Hebrew text was established only in the
second century after the Christian era.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>CHRONICLES</h3>


<p>By the side of this comprehensive history
stands another which is in part parallel, in
part supplementary, to it, Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah.
It differs from the former in
being the work of one author, whose characteristic
conceptions, interests, and manner
make it easy to distinguish his writing from
the sources he incorporates. His peculiarities
are the better known because there is so much
of his own in the books&mdash;not far from half the
matter contained in them.</p>

<p>The succession of the high priests is brought
down to Jaddua, who was contemporary with
Alexander the Great, and lists of heads of
priestly and levitical families are given in Neh.
12 for the reign of Darius (Codomannus), the
last Persian king. The book can, therefore,
not be put much, if any, before 300 <small>B.C.</small>, and
more probably it was written in the following
century.</p>

<p>The history begins with the death of Saul
and the election of David as king by all Israel
at Hebron (1 Chron. 10-11). The preceding
chapters are filled with genealogies, beginning
with Adam. Twenty-six verses bring us to
Abraham, and the second chapter opens with
the sons of Israel, while the third is a list of
the sons of David and of his successors on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
throne to the fall of the kingdom, with the
descendants of the last king through several
generations. These genealogies, to which
historical notices of different kinds are frequently
attached, are in part compiled from
various places in the Pentateuch and Historical
Books, in part more freely reproduced from
such passages; but a large remainder has no
parallel in the older work. The author, here
as elsewhere, evidently attaches great importance
to these lists, in particular to those
which enabled the families of his own time,
clerical and lay, or the inhabitants of towns
and villages, to trace their pedigree back to
remote times.</p>

<p>It is not without reason that the historical
narrative sets in with David, and that the first
event of his reign recorded is the taking of
Jerusalem; for Jerusalem is from first to last
the centre of the author's interest. He writes
the history of Judah alone, touching upon the
kingdom of Israel only in its relation to Judah.
The desire to magnify and glorify the kingdom
of Judah in its great days, especially under
David and Solomon, to represent it as the most
powerful, wealthy, and magnificent among
the nations, not only of its time but of any
time, frequently expresses itself in enormous
exaggerations. David could raise a native
army of a million and a half, almost as many
as, according to Herodotus&mdash;who certainly
does not underestimate the numbers&mdash;Xerxes
mustered from the whole Persian empire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the invasion of Greece; he laid away, "out
of his poverty," to build the temple, a hundred
thousand talents of gold and a million talents
of silver&mdash;over three times the national debt
of the United Kingdom in 1912; at the dedication
of the temple Solomon sacrificed 22,000
bullocks and 120,000 sheep and goats; and
so on. It is evident that the author has raised
the figures out of the grasp of his own imagination.</p>

<p>From the same motive, if it is possible to
avoid it, he tells nothing to discredit the kings
whom he thus extols. David's sin in taking
a census is necessarily related, because the
sequel of it was the choice of a site for the
future temple, but, characteristically, not God
but Satan tempted him to number the people;
otherwise none of the misdeeds and misfortunes
which are set down so impartially in 2 Samuel
is so much as alluded to by the Chronicler;
David is in his pages the model king. Solomon
fares as well; nothing is said of the perverting
influence of his foreign wives nor the temples
he erected to their gods. Indeed, his piety is
such that he will not allow Pharaoh's daughter,
apparently the only foreign wife the Chronicler
gives him, to live in the city of David, for the
neighbourhood of the ark is holy. Solomon's
press-gangs were one of the greatest grievances
of the tribes; the author of Chronicles
takes pains to aver that Solomon raised his
corvée from the remnants of the Hittites and
other heathen; no Israelites were put to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
work. In Kings we read that Solomon ceded
twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram, king of
Tyre, in payment for materials and services in
the building of the temple; to the Chronicler
such a transaction is unimaginable, and he
amends it by making Hiram give the towns
to Solomon.</p>

<p>All this is, however, incidental to the main
purpose of the book to exalt Jerusalem as the
religious capital, its temple as the place which
God has chosen for his abode, its liturgy as the
correct form of worship, its priests and levites
as the only ministry of valid orders and unimpeachable
succession. It is not solely the
pride of the churchman which prompts him
to dwell on these things. The assertion is so
emphasized and reiterated that we can hardly
mistake in inferring a controversial animus,
especially when we recall that at the time of
writing there was a rival temple on Mt.
Gerizim near Shechem, at one of the most
venerable holy places in the land.</p>

<p>This temple is said by Josephus to have
been erected in the time of Alexander the
Great, in avowed rivalry to the temple in
Jerusalem. The high priests of the Samaritan
temple were a branch of the Jewish high-priestly
line, its ritual was the same, the
Pentateuch was the Law in Shechem as well
as in Jerusalem. If the Jews maintained that
Jerusalem was the only place in the land where
sacrifice might lawfully be made to God, the
Samaritans made the same exclusive claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for their temple: Shechem, not Jerusalem,
was the place (unnamed in Deuteronomy)
which God had chosen out of all the tribes to
put his name there. At Shechem was held
the first great religious assembly of Israel
after the invasion of Canaan; there, on
Gerizim, the first altar of Jehovah was erected
by his express command (see Deut. xi. 26-29;
Jos. viii. 30-35; Jos. 24; especially
Deut. xxvii. 4, where "Ebal" in the Jewish
Bible is an anti-Samaritan substitute for the
original "Gerizim"). The rivalry of Shechem
was thus a serious menace, and so the Jerusalem
Jews treated it.</p>

<p>In their eyes the people of the old territory
of Ephraim were descendants of the assorted
heathen whom the Assyrian kings had
colonized in the cities of Samaria after transplanting
to the eastern provinces of the empire
the old Israelite population of the region (see
2 Kings 17&mdash;a very late passage&mdash;noting
especially vs. 34, "unto this day"). On
the other hand, Jerusalem and the region
about it, after lying waste for seventy years,
had been repeopled under Cyrus by Jews of
pure race returning from the exile in Babylonia,
who rebuilt the temple and restored the
worship as prescribed in the law. They were
surrounded by the "peoples of the land,"
who were regarded as descendants of the
ancient heathen of Canaan with whom intermarriage
was forbidden in the law. This is
the Chronicler's representation: the returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
exiles are the only genuine stock, their priesthood
the only legitimate sons of Aaron, the
rest of the ministry, down to the temple slaves,
was authenticated by recorded pedigrees (see
Ezra ii. 59-63), and the elaborate liturgy of
his own time the same in all particulars which
had been used in the temple from its foundation.</p>

<p>The author has an exaggerated interest in
this liturgy, and especially in the part taken in
it by the minor orders of the clergy, levites,
musicians, singers, door-keepers, and the rest.
The levites are provided for in the Pentateuch,
but the orchestra and choruses, according to
the Chronicler, were organized by David
(1 Chron. 23-26), who thus provided for the
proper execution of his Psalms. When a
great religious function is described, the music
invariably comes in for a prominent notice
(e.g. 2 Chron. v. 12 f.).</p>

<p>We have seen that the historians of the
seventh and following centuries, the so-called
deuteronomist school, wrote or interpreted
the history to exemplify the doctrine that
defection from the national religion is surely
punished by national calamities. The
Chronicler's doctrine of retribution is at once
harder and more individual. He also turns it
about: unusual suffering is proof of sin.
Thus, Asa was, according to Kings, a conspicuously
good king, but in his old age he
had the gout. The Chronicler, by the mouth
of a prophet, explains why: he relied on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
king of Syria to help him against Israel,
instead of relying on the Lord. The king
clapped the prophet into prison for meddling
with affairs of state, and so added another
affront to God. He was impenitent, however,
for though the gout was very bad, "yet sought
he not unto the Lord, but to the physicians."
Uzziah, another godly king, was in his later
years afflicted with leprosy, a disease which
was regarded as peculiarly the stroke of God.
The Chronicler gives the reason: the king
presumed to burn incense on the altar in spite
of the protest of the priest, and was smitten
with leprosy on the spot.</p>

<p>There is no reason to impugn the author's
good faith in such emendations of his sources.
He thought he knew the laws of history, and
if in the particular instance the record did not
correspond, it must be defective. But whatever
apology may be made for his good
intentions, it need hardly be said that the
unsupported testimony of a doctrinaire historian
who deals so sovereignly with the facts
is of no weight.</p>

<p>The Chronicler names a considerable number
of books as authorities for different periods of
the history; the Book of the Kings of Judah
and Israel (or Israel and Judah) and the Book
of the Kings of Israel are repeatedly cited for
things not related in our Book of Kings. For
more information about Joash the reader is
referred to the "Midrash of the Book of
Kings," and for Abijah to the "Midrash of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Prophet Iddo," titles that in later times, at
least, would designate an edifying exposition
in which full licence was given to the imagination
to embroider the theme with picturesque
inventions. The favourite references, however,
are to writings bearing the names of
prophets&mdash;Samuel, Nathan, Gad, Ahijah, Iddo,
Shemaiah, Jehu son of Hanani. The title
History of Samuel the Seer, of Nathan the
Prophet, and so on, may mean either <i>about</i>
Samuel or <i>by</i> Samuel. Very likely the author
entertained the theory which subsequently
prevailed among the Jews that in each age the
prophets wrote down the events of their own
time in which many of them had a conspicuous
part.</p>

<p>The question is of no other interest; for an
examination of the extracts from his sources
which the Chronicler has incorporated or condensed
shows that (with small possible exceptions
to be considered hereafter) his material
was all taken from our Book of Kings. This
enables us to confront his history of Judah
with his sources and acquaint ourselves with
his habitual way of dealing with them, an
investigation not only instructive for his
method, but of the greatest importance when
we come to the Chronicler's history of the
Persian period, where, for the most part, his
sources are not independently preserved.</p>

<p>In the first place it will be noticed that he
has selected from the history in Samuel and
Kings the parts which particularly interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
him for their own sake, such as the description
of religious ceremonies, or could be used as a
text for the doctrines he had most at heart,
and has therefore passed over a very large
part of the contents of his source. Precisely
so, the author of Kings, two centuries earlier,
had dealt with his sources, though with a
different interest. What the Chronicler chose
to include he generally copied out without
much change; the present variations in the
text are chiefly due to divergent transmission.
(Compare, for illustration, 1 Chron. x. 1-xi.
47 with 1 Sam. 31 and 2 Sam. xxiii. 8-39,
or 1 Chron. xvii. 1-xx. 8 with 2 Sam. 7, 8,
10 and 12.). Often he introduces in these
extracts, or appends to them, notes of his own
which would in almost all cases be certainly
recognizable on internal evidence even if we
had not the text of Kings before us. In a few
places he condenses or abridges the narrative
of Kings, as in 2 Chron. xxxii. 1-23 compared
with 2 Kings xviii. 13-xix. 37.</p>

<p>Of alterations, or, from the author's own
point of view, corrections, of the older history
several examples have been given above.
One more, of a striking character, may be
cited, viz. 2 Chron. xxii. 10-xxiii. 21 compared
with 2 Kings 11. The Carian mercenaries of
the guard in the sacred precincts of the temple
(2 Kings xi. 4) were a plain profanation, of
which the pious chief priest could not have
been guilty. The Chronicler accordingly rewrites
the story, substituting the levites (note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
2 Chron. xxiii. 6) for the obnoxious heathen.
Finally, he sometimes freely expands on his
text, as in the building of Solomon's temple
(2 Chron. 2-3).</p>

<p>In view of the Chronicler's multiplied references
to authorities, it has frequently been
assumed that his immediate source was not
the Books of Samuel and Kings, but a work of
a "midrashic" character&mdash;that is, euphemistically,
a work with more concern for edification
than for historical verity&mdash;written not long
before his time from the same point of view
and with the same salient interests, which the
Chronicler in all simplicity took for authentic
history. This ghost source eludes, however,
all attempts to catch it actually walking. It
may perfectly well be that the Chronicler did
not invent everything in the book which is
plainly invention, but if not, we can only
apply the famous contribution of an undergraduate
to Homeric criticism, "the Iliad
was not written by Homer, but by another
man of the same name."</p>

<p>There remain a few short notices, not
derived from the Pentateuch or Historical
Books, whose contents and form suggest that
they are scraps which the Chronicler picked
up from some other source, e.g. the migration
of the Simeonites, 1 Chron. iv. 24-43 (in the
main). But these passages are so few, and
generally of so little historical importance,
that the question need here not be pursued
farther.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>EZRA AND NEHEMIAH</h3>


<p>The books which in our Bible bear the names
Ezra and Nehemiah (in the Jewish Bible, one
book, Ezra) are the immediate continuation of
Chronicles, by the same author. When they
were divided, 2 Chron. xxxvi. 22-23, the
necessary sequel of vss. 20-21 was repeated
at the beginning of Ezra (Ezra i. 1-3). The
reason for the division is plain: down to the
end of the exile the work was no more than an
epitome of the Pentateuch and Historical
Books; but from the time of Cyrus to Alexander
it was the only history the Jews possessed.
This part was therefore separated
from what went before as the book of post-exilic
history, and named "Ezra" after the
figure most prominent in the earlier half of it,
on the same principle that the history of the
founding of the kingdom was named Samuel.
The subdivision into two books of Ezra as in
the Greek Bible, or as we name them Ezra and
Nehemiah, is apparently due to Christian
hands.</p>

<p>This part of the Chronicler's work begins,
as has been said, with an edict of Cyrus permitting
the Jews in Babylonia to return to
Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. There
follows a list (given again in Neh. 7) of the
families who availed themselves of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
permission, shortly after 538 <small>B.C.</small> The restoration
of the temple is begun, then stopped
by the machinations of their enemies under
Xerxes (486-465 <small>B.C.</small>) and Artaxerxes (465-424
<small>B.C.</small>), but happily completed (by the same
Zerubbabel and Joshua who began it) in the
sixth year of Darius (Nothus, 424-405 <small>B.C.</small>).
"After these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes,"
Ezra came up from Babylonia, armed
with large powers by an edict of the king, to
order things according to the law of his God in
the province "beyond the river" (Euphrates,
Ezra 7 f.). He found things enough that
needed reform; particularly the frequent
intermarriages of all classes, including the
clergy, with the "peoples of the land," and
succeeded in inducing the Jews, in a great act
of penitence, to divorce these "foreign
women" (cc. 9-10).</p>

<p>At this point the History of Nehemiah sets
in abruptly in the form of personal memoirs.
Nehemiah, a favourite cup-bearer of the
Persian king Artaxerxes, hearing that the wall
of Jerusalem was broken down and the gates
burned, asks permission to go thither and
repair the damaged fortifications, and is sent
with a commission as royal governor of the
district. In spite of dangerous opposition from
jealous neighbours in Samaria and elsewhere,
by the utmost endeavours he accomplishes
the rebuilding of the walls in a very brief
space (Neh. 1-6). In all this there is not so
much as a mention of Ezra, who is supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to have been now thirteen years in Jerusalem,
but in Neh. 8 he suddenly appears on the
scene with his law-book. The law is read, and
the people solemnly covenant by sign and seal
to observe it; Nehemiah's name stands at
the head of the list of signers, but otherwise
he is entirely ignored (Neh. 8-10). Lists of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem and of other
settlements, a catalogue of the priests and
levites who came up under Cyrus, and a description
of the dedication of the walls, in
which the singers shine, fill Neh. 11-12.
That the Chronicler is the author is palpable.
Finally, in c. 13, Nehemiah, who had returned
to court, reappears, and finds a sad state of
things; a foreigner, and an Ammonite at that,
lodged by the high priest in a chamber of the
temple, flagrant violations of the sabbath by
market men, and the old grievance of mixed
marriages in full gait. Even the high priest's
family was not pure: one of its scions
was son-in-law to Nehemiah's arch-enemy,
Sanballat of Samaria. Naturally Nehemiah
expelled him.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this somewhat
detailed synopsis of the books to make intelligible
the problems they present. On this point
it is further to be observed that the book is
not all written in Hebrew: Ezra iv. 8-vi.
18; vii. 12-26, containing chiefly correspondence
with the Persian court and documents
issuing from it, are in Aramaic, the
official language of the western provinces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the empire. Moreover, the oldest Greek
translation of the Chronicler's history, part of
which is preserved in the Bible of the church
as 1 Esdras, differs both in matter and order
from the Jewish standard text and the later
Greek version; it contains, for example, the
famous exhibition of wits by the three Jewish
youths at the court of Darius (1 Esdr. 3 f.),
as a result of which Zerubbabel obtains from
Darius permission to go up to Jerusalem.
In 1 Esdras the reading of the law (Neh. 8)
immediately follows the act of penitence for
the strange wives (Ezra 10).</p>

<p>A large part of Ezra-Nehemiah exhibits the
Chronicler's familiar motives and manner;
in other places he has incorporated extracts
from the sources with or without annotations
of his own. Of these sources the only ones
which have been independently preserved
are the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah,
from which the author takes, however, no
more than the facts that at the instance
of these prophets Zerubbabel and Joshua
began to rebuild the temple in the second
year of Darius (Ezra v. 1 f.); the completion
of the work by the same hands,
which according to the Chronicler took place
in the sixth year of Darius and was celebrated
in a great dedication ceremony, is in Zech.
iv. 9 still prediction. Another source which
stands out distinctly is the Memoirs of
Nehemiah, of which Neh. 1-6 (except c. 3)
is a solid piece. There is, moreover, a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of documents: Ezra 1, the edict of Cyrus;
Ezra iv. 7-vi. 12, complaints to the court of
the Jews' building operations, and answers of
the kings Artaxerxes and Darius respectively.
Ezra vii. 11-26, commission of Artaxerxes
to Ezra. A diplomatic appearance is given
to these by the fact that&mdash;except the edict
of Cyrus&mdash;they are all couched in the official
Aramaic; and, inasmuch as in cc. iv. 7-vi.
18 the connecting links of narrative are also
in Aramaic, the presumption is that this
material was taken bodily from an Aramaic
book in which the letters and rescripts were
already embodied.</p>

<p>Finally, a distinct source is commonly
assumed for the history of Ezra. This is
chiefly told of Ezra in the third person;
but in some parts for a considerable space
together Ezra speaks in the first person
(I or we), and it is accordingly thought
by most scholars that the Chronicler had in
his hands Memoirs of Ezra as well as of
Nehemiah, which in part he incorporated
intact (e.g. Ezra 8 f.), in part recast into the
form of a narrative about Ezra (as in Ezra
10; Neh. 8 f.). It is evident that the story of
Ezra, whatever its origin, is badly dislocated:
the chapters which now stand in Neh. 8-10
have no business there, and, as has been
noticed above, in 1 Esdras the reading of the
law immediately follows Ezra 10. On the
other hand, there is a gap at the end of Ezra
6; chapter 9 cannot well be its original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
sequel. And, lastly, Neh. 9 f. does not seem
naturally to follow c. 8. The most probable
restoration of the order is Ezra 8; Neh.
vii. 70-73; 8; Ezra 9-10; Neh. 9-10.
This arrangement gives a continuous and
consistent story, and the numerous dates
fall into sequence. Incidentally another connection
is thus restored, Neh. 11 follows vii.
5<small><sup>a</sup></small>. The list (Neh. vii. 5<small><sup>b</sup></small>-60) of the exiles who
returned with Zerubbabel and his company
( = Ezra 2) is obviously not what is required
here. The dismemberment of the story of
Ezra is not to be attributed to the Chronicler,
but to misadventures of copying such as are
not infrequent in ancient manuscripts.</p>

<p>The extract from the Memoirs of Nehemiah
breaks off with Neh. 6; though perhaps
in vii. 1-4; xi. 1-3 the Chronicler has utilized
in his own way some further sentences. In
Neh. xii. 27-43, the procession at the dedication
of the walls is described, ostensibly by
Nehemiah in the first person, and the passage
has on this ground been taken for an extract
from the Memoirs. It is, however, an unmistakable
piece of the Chronicler's own
composition. In c. 13, also, Nehemiah, in
the first person, gives an account of his reforming
enterprises on a second visit to
Jerusalem. An unaltered extract from the
Memoirs, however, the chapter cannot well
be; the Chronicler's vein crops out in too
many places.</p>

<p>It does not belong to our present task to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
discuss the historical value of these sources;
but it may not be amiss to say that the
authority of the Memoirs of Nehemiah alone
is unimpeached. The question is of peculiar
interest in the case of the supposed Memoirs of
Ezra, because Neh. 8 has been generally understood
by recent critics to be the account of the
formal introduction of a new, or newly codified,
law, the Priests' Code or the Pentateuch,
which Ezra brought up from Babylonia.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>STORY BOOKS: ESTHER, RUTH, JONAH</h3>


<p>Besides the older and younger historical books
we have been considering, the Jewish Bible
contains some examples of what we should
call the short story, and the church has
preserved others. The canonical books of
this class are Esther, Ruth, and Jonah;
among the apocrypha are Judith and Tobit;
others, such as 3 Maccabees, are found in
manuscripts of the Greek and Latin Bibles,
or in Oriental translations, but did not attain
official recognition of any of the great
churches. These stories, which, as might
be expected, differ widely in literary quality
as well as in subject and motive, are doubtless
only the rare survivors of a larger literature
of this kind, but they suffice to give us a notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the popular reading of the Jews in the last
centuries before the Christian era. It would
be more exact, perhaps, to say the popular
story-telling, for probably the written books
were chiefly used by the story-tellers, who
reproduced their contents orally and freely,
just as the Moslem story-tellers to-day recite
stories from the Arabian Nights or the Antar
romance. Some of them, however, like Esther,
attached themselves to popular festivals
and were recited or read as part of the
celebration.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Esther.</span>&mdash;Esther is the story of a beautiful
Jewess of Susa whom Xerxes raises from the
ranks of his concubines to be his queen, and
who uses her influence over him to save her
people from a general massacre which the
grand vizier has prepared for them by way of
avenging an affront from one of the race.
The plot is developed with noteworthy art.
The deposition of Vashti, which, so far as
the main matter goes, is necessary only to
make room for Esther, under the author's hand
becomes a brilliant first act. The embroilment
of Mordecai and Haman is skilfully
managed; the stiffnecked Jew refuses homage
to the proud vizier, who schemes a generous
revenge. Esther ventures her life for her
people by intruding into the audience
chamber, but the <i>dénouement</i> is artfully
retarded&mdash;instead of a pathetic plea for the
imperilled Jews, an invitation for the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and his prime minister to a <i>petit dîner</i> in the
queen's apartments! At the banquet the
king offers Esther her wish, but again the
issue is postponed. Haman, in his elation at
such signal marks of queenly favour, builds
a gallows for Mordecai seventy-five feet high&mdash;and
next day has to parade the streets of
the capital at the bridle of the hated Jew's
horse proclaiming him the object of the king's
special honour!</p>

<p>The scene in the banqueting hall when
Esther at last makes her petition is highly
dramatic. She makes it a plea for her own
life, "for we are sold, I and my people,
to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish."
The king, who has no inkling that she is a
Jewess, and is incensed at the thought of
such a plot against his queen, angrily asks,
"Who is he, and where is he, that durst
presume in his heart to do so?" The
climax so skilfully prepared comes in the
stunning words, "This wicked Haman here!"
Thenceforth the action matches swiftly: the
king bursts out of the room to collect himself
by a turn in the garden; the fallen vizier
sinks a suppliant on the queen's couch, where
the king, returning, finds him; the sinister
eunuch standing by describes the fine new gallows
Haman has at home, ready for Mordecai,
and on his own gallows, in poetic justice,
Haman is hanged, fifty cubits high! Mordecai
succeeds to the seal of state, and conceives
the counter-stroke by which, instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
heathen massacring the Jews, the Jews
slaughter the heathen. An annual festival
celebrates the joyful issue.</p>

<p>For the full account of Mordecai's greatness
the reader is referred to the royal annals of
Media and Persia, where it will be found, he
says, recorded along with the mighty deeds
of Xerxes, including his subjugation of the
Greeks. Despite this authority, it should
be unnecessary to say that the Book of
Esther is a work of fiction. Whether it is pure
invention, or whether some of the incidents
are borrowed from fact, is an idle question,
because a wholly unanswerable one. If the
local colour, which is laid on pretty thick,
is good, as some modern archæologists aver,
it would not be strange that a Jewish novelist
who wrote not so long after the passing of
Persia should prove as well acquainted with
it as a modern archæologist.</p>

<p>Some recent interpreters find in the story
a mythical background: Esther is Ishtar,
the Babylonian goddess of love; Mordecai,
"Marduk's man," was originally Marduk
himself, the great god of Babylon; the name of
Haman sounds something like one way of pronouncing
the name of an Elamite god in the
epic of Gilgamesh. The triumph of Mordecai
and Esther over Haman would thus be an echo
of ancient strife between the gods of Babylonia
and Elam. It will be obvious, however,
to the mythologically unsophisticated understanding,
that if these very problematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
combinations are right, the author of the
Book of Esther was quite innocent of them,
and therefore that for the interpretation
of the story he tells they are wholly
irrelevant.</p>

<p>The Book of Esther, it was long ago observed,
is singular among the books of the Bible in that
there is no mention of God in it. It is Jewish
with a sanguinary loyalty to race, but of
Judaism as religion there is not a trace; it is
in fact somewhat obtrusive by its absence.
When Mordecai warns Esther that if she fails
her people in their hour of need deliverance
will come "from another place," the word
God is ostentatiously avoided; before her
great adventure she fasts three days, but
there is no suggestion of prayer; in the celebrations
of rescue and the annual commemoration
of it there is feasting and gladness, but
no thanksgiving to God. It is no wonder
that orthodox rabbis doubted the inspiration
of so conspicuously secular romance, nor that
the Greek translators made good the religious
deficiencies of the book by putting pious
prayers into the mouth of Mordecai and Esther
at the appropriate junctures.</p>

<p>The age of the book cannot be very closely
determined; it is pretty certainly not older
than the third century <small>B.C.</small>, more likely from
the second. A note at the end of the Greek
version says that this translation was brought
from Jerusalem to Egypt in the year which
corresponds to 114 <small>B.C.</small> The earliest mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the festival of Purim is in 2 Macc. xv. 36,
where it is called Mordecai Day.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span>&mdash;The story of Ruth is laid in the time
of the Judges, for which reason it was placed
in the Greek Bible and in modern versions
between Judges and Samuel. It tells of a
young Moabitess, the childless widow of a
Judæan from Bethlehem, who accompanies
her widowed mother-in-law back to Bethlehem,
embracing her religion. Ruth goes out to
glean after the reapers and by chance comes
to the field of Boaz, a kinsman of her husband,
who shows her kindness. By Naomi's contrivance,
she reveals to him who she is under
circumstances that appeal to his chivalry,
and, after a nearer of kin has waived his
right, Boaz takes the widow with the land, and
they live happy ever after. Their son Obed
is David's grandfather. The legal proceedings
in the last chapter are different from anything
we otherwise know of Israelite custom, but
our ignorance is no warrant for assuming that
the usage there described is fictitious.</p>

<p>If the story of Esther is told with dramatic
power, that of Ruth is told with idyllic grace.
The pathos of the moment in which Naomi bids
her daughters-in-law return to their mothers'
homes and Ruth refuses to part from her
is unforced. The picture of the gleaners in
the fields; the delicacy with which the night
at the threshing-floor is treated; the scene
at the city gate, where the waiver and redemption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
are witnessed and the shoe given in attestation;
the blessing of the townsmen on the
union, all have the charm of simple and
unaffected narrative.</p>

<p>The question what the book was written
for has received diverse answers. It has been
thought that the author meant to protest
against the narrowness of those who condemned
all marriages with foreigners and put
the Moabites under a special ban, by showing
that David himself had Moabite blood in
his veins; others see the point of the book
in the commendation of the marriage of
childless widows, not by brothers-in-law only
as the levirate law required, but by remoter
kinsmen. Others have conjectured otherwise.
In this state of the case it is safe to say
that if the author had an ulterior motive, he
concealed it more successfully than is common
to story-tellers who write with a purpose.</p>

<p>There are no very definite signs in the book
of the age in which it was written. The author
is familiar with the Hebrew literature of the
good period, and writes a better imitation of
it than some. It is precisely this imitative
character which stands in the way of putting
the book in the days of the kingdom. But
where, in the centuries of the Persian or
Greek dominion it belongs, it is impossible
to say.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Jonah.</span>&mdash;The third of the short stories,
Jonah, is not found, like Esther and Ruth, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the Jewish Bible in the miscellaneous collection
of "Scriptures" and in the Christian
Bible among the Historical Books, but in
the prophetic canon, as one of the Minor
Prophets. The reason, doubtless, is that it is
not only a story about a prophet and his
mission, but was thought to be written by
himself.</p>

<p>The tale is too familiar to have to be retold
at length. The Israelite prophet, Jonah the
son of Amittai, is commissioned by God to
go to Nineveh and announce its impending
destruction; to escape this unwelcome errand
he embarks on a Ph&oelig;nician ship bound for
Spain, at the other end of the world; a tempest
threatens to engulf the ship; the seamen
cast lots to discover against whom the gods
are so angry; the lot falls on Jonah, and he
is cast into the sea, which thereupon becomes
calm; Jonah is swallowed by a monstrous
fish, which after three days sets him ashore
safe and sound. He goes to Nineveh and
delivers his message; the people repent of
their sins, and God repents of his purpose
to destroy them, whereat the prophet is very
indignant and upbraids God with his soft-heartedness;
he expected this from the
beginning, and therefore tried to flee to
Tarshish. By his own grief for the death
of the plant "which sprang up in a night and
perished in a night," the prophet is taught
the lesson of the divine compassion: "How
should I not have compassion on this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
city, Nineveh, in which are more than a
hundred and twenty thousand human beings
which do not know their right hand from
their left, not to speak of cattle?" With
this rebuke the book ends.</p>

<p>These closing words leave no room for
question about the purpose of the book.
In the person of Jonah, the rebuke is addressed
to the Jews, to whom God's long-suffering
with the heathen was a stumbling-block.
The greater prophetic books, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, all contain a long array of oracles
against foreign nations, predicting their total
and remediless destruction, some of them very
precise as to time and agent (see, for example,
Isa. 13 f., against Babylon). The fulfilment
of these prophecies, the final breaking of the
power of the heathen world, must come before
the golden age of Israel could dawn. Yet
the generations came and went, and the
heathen still ruled the earth! Then, too, the
Jews doubtless felt that they, as the people of
God, had an exclusive claim on his affections,
as he asserted exclusive claims to theirs.
The author of Jonah not only extends to
mankind God's word in Ezekiel, "Have I any
pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith
the Lord God, and not rather that he should
return from his way and live?" but he asserts
the all-embracing compassion of God. The one
God is the creator of the heathen as well as of
Israel, his merciful providence is over all his
works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>The higher spirit of Judaism here reproves
the lower, narrow, exclusive, and intolerant
spirit, which could unfortunately allege so
much warrant for itself from the law and the
prophets. Therein the author had many and
noble successors, not only among the sages,
with their cosmopolitan wisdom, but in the
circles of the law.</p>

<p>It is not the fault of the author that modern
readers and interpreters have had their attention
diverted from the moral of the book to the
fable in which it is conveyed; he could not
have imagined the pseudo-historical frame
of mind to which the question whether it all
happened thus and so was of such absorbing
importance that it might almost be said that
the sea-monster swallowed the commentators
as well as the prophet. For one of the
difficulties of the book he is not responsible,
the psalm (Jonah ii. 2-9) which Jonah sings
in the fish's belly was put in his mouth by
a later editor; vs. 10 is the immediate sequel
of vs. 1. The poem was evidently not composed
for the place; it is a hymn of thanksgiving
not a prayer for deliverance; but the
(figurative) references to the depths of the
abyss seemed appropriate to Jonah's situation.</p>

<p>The hero of the story is a historical character,
of whom, to be sure, we know only that he
came from a place named Gath-hepher, and
predicted the reconquest of lost Israelite
territories which Jeroboam II. achieved (2
Kings xiv. 25). It has been conjectured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that the author of our book may have heard
in some way that he went on a mission to
Nineveh; but if he had, that would not make
the book any more historical.</p>

<p>Jonah, like Ruth and Esther, belongs to the
later period of Hebrew literature; it is more
likely that it was written after the time of
Alexander than before, but greater definiteness
is not justified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE PROPHETS</h3>


<p>In the old story of Saul and Samuel (1 Sam.
9 f.) Samuel is named "the seer," that is,
a man endowed with what we call second
sight, and a note by an editor explains that
what in his time was called a prophet used
to be called a seer. Samuel was, indeed, in
the apprehension of later times, a prophet, but
the story itself makes a clear distinction
between the two. The band of prophets whom
Saul meets coming down from the high place,
working up by music an enthusiasm, or possession,
which makes them beside themselves,
raving in the prophetic fury (raving and
prophesying, in such connections, is the same
word in Hebrew), an enthusiasm which Saul
catches, to the surprise and scandal of his
townsmen, are evidently something quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
different from the village seer; they must
have been outwardly very much like modern
Moslem dervishes.</p>

<p>In the ninth century of the Syrian wars, these
gregarious prophets appear in many places;
especially in the stories of Elisha they are
organized societies of devotees, living by themselves
in colonies of huts or cells under a
superior&mdash;again very much like a dervish
order&mdash;and sometimes turning their religious
zeal into political channels, as when they incite
Jehu to the revolt which overthrew the house
of Omri.</p>

<p>Beside them are others who also bear the
name prophet, but stand apart from the order
and often in opposition to it. Such a figure
is Micaiah son of Imlah, confronting the four
hundred prophets whom Ahab got together,
and declaring their unanimity of inspiration to
be the work of a lying spirit sent from God
to lure the king to his doom (1 Kings 22).
Such a figure, above all as we have already
seen, is Elijah, who, solitary, champions
Jehovah's right to the undivided allegiance
of Israel, or thunders the doom of the dynasty
at the authors of Naboth's judicial murder.
It is in such men as these, rather than in the
common herd of prophets by profession, that
the ethical prophets of the eighth century
have their forerunners.</p>

<p>The moral conception of God had its roots
far down in the religion of Israel, as may
be seen in the older (certainly preprophetic)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
strata in Samuel, and better still in the patriarchal
legends, which received their present
form in the same age; but after the establishment
of the kingdom it was crossed by the
national idea. It was not till the eighth century
that the men came who thought through
what the moral idea of God involves, and
had the courage to proclaim its consequences,
fatal though they might be to both state
and church. These prophets, beginning with
Amos, not only preached a new doctrine,
they employed a new method. The message
which they spoke to the heedless, incredulous,
or hostile ears of their contemporaries, they
also recorded, whether in the hope to reach
through the written page a larger audience,
or to perpetuate their words to generations
following. Thus there begins a prophetic literature
which is one of the most characteristic
features of the Old Testament. Four prophets
of the second half of the eighth century have
given their names to such prophetic books,
Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah. Then, in the
latter part of the seventh century and the
beginning of the sixth, follow the little books of
Zephaniah, Nahum, and Habbakuk, and the
great one of Jeremiah, whose younger contemporary
in Babylonia is Ezekiel. Haggai and
Zechariah were instrumental in the rebuilding
of the temple in the reign of Darius I. In the
discussion of these books we shall not attempt
a chronological disposition, but follow the
order of the English Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>ISAIAH</h3>


<p>The first of the prophetic books bears the
name of Isaiah, a Judæan prophet, who dates
his call "in the year that king Uzziah died," a
year which cannot be fixed with certainty,
but was at all events not very long before
734 <small>B.C.</small>, and whose latest dated utterances
are from the time of Sennacherib's invasion in
the year 701. His prophecies thus range over
a period of not far from forty years. He
witnessed the humbling of Israel by Tiglath-Pileser
in 734, the fall of Samaria in
721, the Assyrian campaigns in the west
in 720 and 711, and the condign punishment
Sennacherib inflicted on Judah in 701;
and all these events (of which we have
historical knowledge from both Assyrian and
Jewish sources) are reflected in his prophecies.</p>

<p>The book contains, however, much besides
the prophecies of Isaiah in the different
periods of his long career. It has already
been noted that Isa. 36-39 are found also,
with some variations, in 2 Kings 18-20, where
they are an integral part of the narrative.
That this extract from Kings was copied into
the Book of Isaiah is explained by the fact
that the prophet is a prominent figure in the
story. It does not stand in immediate
connection with the prophecies of Isaiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
during the campaign of Sennacherib in
cc. 28-33, from which it is separated by
several oracles of different character and date;
and the natural presumption is that this
historical appendix was added at the end
of a roll, just as Jer. 52, also an extract from
Kings (2 Kings xxiv. 18-xxv. 21), is appended
at the end of the roll of Jeremiah.</p>

<p>In the present Book of Isaiah, cc. 36-39
are followed by another prophetic book of
considerable length (Isa. 40-66), which has
no title, and in which, from first to last, no
prophet's name appears. The theme which
is announced in the first verses of this book
and runs through a large part of it is the
approaching deliverance of the Jews from
the Babylonian captivity, their return to
their own land, and the restoration of Zion.</p>

<p>In Isa. 1-35 certain larger divisions are at
once apparent; cc. 1-12, a collection of
prophecies, chiefly, as appears from dates
and other indications, from the earlier years
of Isaiah's ministry; cc. 13 to 23, a collection
of oracles mainly against foreign nations;
cc. 24-27, previsions of a great judgment,
in a peculiarly mysterious tone; cc. 28-33,
chiefly from the time of Sennacherib, followed
by c. 34, in which God's fury is poured out on
Edom, and c. 35, a prophecy of restoration
akin to cc. 40 ff. It is thus evident that the
present book is made up from several older
collections of prophecies gathered by different
hands; the peculiar titles in cc. 13-23, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
instance, are most probably to be attributed
to the editor of an independent book of
prophecies against the heathen.</p>

<p>The same phenomenon appears on a smaller
scale in Isa. 1-12. That these chapters, at one
stage in the history of the collections, formed a
roll by themselves is probable from the fact
that they begin with a grand overture (c. 1),
in which the leading motives of Isaiah's
prophecy are heard, and close (c. 12) with a
psalm of praise for the messianic deliverance
which is the subject of c. 11. But the order
of the prophecies is not chronological: the
inaugural vision and Isaiah's call to be a
prophet stands, not at the beginning, as in
Jeremiah and Ezekiel, but in c. 6 (dated in
the year of King Uzziah's death), while the
chapters that precede it (cc. 2 f.; 5), with
what was once an initial title (ii. 1), may
confidently be assigned, on internal grounds,
to the reigns of Uzziah's successors. Chapters
7 and 8 (dated under Ahaz) seem to have originally
followed close on c. 6, as they do now.
Whatever may be the reason for this singular
arrangement, it seems evident that the compiler
had several smaller groups or loose leaves
of oracles, which he put together for better
preservation, rather, perhaps, by affinity of
subject than in order of time.</p>

<p>This must have taken place at a comparatively
late time, for not only does his roll begin
with a prophecy (Isa. i. 2-9) which vividly
depicts the devastation of Judah and the isolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of Jerusalem by Sennacherib in 701 (perhaps
the latest oracle of Isaiah preserved in
the book), but it contains passages (e.g. xi.
11-16) which bear all the marks of a time
several centuries after Isaiah's death; the
psalm in c. 12 is perhaps later still. Another
indication that the collection was made at a
date remote from the age of the prophet is
the fragmentary character of several of the
oracles in cc. 2-5. The refrain verses here
afford a certain clue; they show that prophecies
originally composed with much art in
balanced strophes with closing refrains came
into the compiler's hands mutilated and dislocated.
Thus, v. 25 has the refrain of
ix. 8-21; x. 4, while x. 1-3 is a "woe" which
has strayed away from v. 18 ff., and the
refrain ii. 9, 11, 17 recurs in v. 15.</p>

<p>Fragmentary as many of these prophecies
are, enough remains to show that Isaiah had
poetical genius as well as unequalled mastery
of the peculiar literary form of the Hebrew
oracle. The parable of the vineyard (Isa.
v. 1-7), or the picture of the swift, resistless
advance of the Assyrian (v. 26-30), or the
description of devastated Judah (i. 2-8), or
the oracle against Samaria (ix. 8-21), in the
authorized English Version illustrate in
different ways the art with which Isaiah
handles this traditional form.</p>

<p>The earlier prophecies of Isaiah, whether
directed against Israel and its allies or against
Judah, are unsparing in their condemnation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the political and social evils of the time, and
predict the imminent and irremediable ruin
of both nations. This is revealed to Isaiah in
the vision which made him a prophet, in terms
so drastic that the closing words were piously
erased by some late editor (so in the Greek
Bible), and a meaningless phrase put in
their place in the curtailed sentence by a still
later hand (our Hebrew text). With this
the tenor of his utterances in cc. ii. 5-iii. 26;
v. 1-30; ix. 8-x. 4, wholly agrees. These
unrelieved forebodings of doom led in later
times not only to excisions such as we have
noted in vi. 13, but to interpolations; hopeful
pendants were attached to the prophet's
gloomy pictures, sometimes written for the
purpose&mdash;a particularly instructive example
is iv. 2-6, after iii. 16-iv. 1&mdash;sometimes
borrowed from other prophetic contexts. To
the latter class belongs the famous messianic
oracle, ix. 1-7, which is very imperfectly
connected (by changes in viii. 22) with the
preceding climactic denunciation of doom,
the end of which is missing. If Isa. ix. 1-7
is a prophecy by Isaiah, it can only belong
to his latest years.</p>

<p>One other feature of Isaiah's message must
be signalized. His God indignantly rejects
the sacrifices and all the pompous worship
which are offered him in his temple in Jerusalem
(Isa. i. 10-17). Men think they can thus
gain the favour of God and persuade him to
overlook or condone their sins against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fellows! Such worship is an insult to God.
So Amos a few years before had condemned
the worship at Bethel (Amos v. 21-25). So
their successors repeat in no uncertain terms
(see Mic. vi. 6-8; Jer. 7, especially vss. 21-23).
It is the fundamental doctrine of prophecy:
the will of God is wholly moral. For worship
he cares nothing at all; for justice, fairness,
and goodness between man and man he
cares everything. Such a God is capable of
destroying the nation for the wrongs men do
their fellow men; he is not capable of being
bribed by offerings, or flattered with psalms,
or wheedled with prayers. He will listen
to no intercession (Jer. xv. 1 ff., after c. 14);
nothing but complete reformation and reparation
will he call repentance&mdash;and there comes
a pass where repentance is impossible.</p>

<p>The book of prophecies against the heathen
(Isa. 13-23) begins with two remarkable
chapters (xiii. 1-xiv. 23) declaring the imminent
destruction of Babylon by the Medes,
whom the prophet sees already in motion
against the doomed city, and exulting over
the descent of the king of Babylon to hell,
greeted by the taunts of the mighty of the
earth who were before him there. The two
prophecies are connected by a prediction of
the deliverance of captive Israel, which will
be restored to its own land and rule over its
oppressors (xiv. 1-4<small><sup>a</sup></small>). The situation is not
that of Isaiah's time, in which Babylon was
a province of the Assyrian empire, and when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
under Merodach Baladan, it for a while
reasserted its independence, seems to have
sought an alliance with Hezekiah against their
common oppressor, Assyria (Isa. 39 = 2 Kings
xx. 12 ff.). The Medes had been in league
with the Babylonians against Assyria until
its fall in 606 <small>B.C.</small>; it was not until the time
of Cyrus that the Medes became a menace to
Babylonia, and only after Cyrus's conquest of
Lydia (546 <small>B.C.</small>) that the turn of Babylon was
visibly come. On the other hand, the sack
and ruin of Babylon, pictured with vengeful
satisfaction in Isa. 13, did not come to pass
at that time. The Persian armies, after a
decisive battle in northern Babylonia, entered
the city in the autumn of 538 without resistance.
Babylonian inscriptions acclaim Cyrus
as a deliverer, and Babylon became one of
the capitals of his great empire. On these
grounds the prophecy is generally thought to
fall between 546 and 538 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>It is immediately followed by a short oracle
(Isa. xiv. 24-27) against the Assyrians, quite
in the tone of the prophecies of Isaiah in the
time of Sennacherib (701 <small>B.C.</small>), and by an enigmatical
warning to the inhabitants of the
Philistine cities, said in the title to have come
"in the year that King Ahaz died." Another
prophecy concerned with the inhabitants of
these cities, bearing Isaiah's name and
definitely dated (711 <small>B.C.</small>), is Isa. 20. Chapter
17, entitled "The Burden of Damascus,"
is in fact chiefly against the kingdom of Israel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and falls in line with prophecies of Isaiah
in the time of the alliance of the two kingdoms
against Judah (ca. 736 <small>B.C.</small>); compare Isa. 7.
In Isa. xxii. 15-25 is a prophecy of Isaiah
singular in the fact that it is launched at an
individual, the major domo of King Hezekiah.</p>

<p>Besides these, the collection contains oracles
against Moab (Isa. 15 f.), Nubia (c. 18), Egypt
(c. 19), another vision of the fall of Babylon
before the armies of Elam and Media (xxi.
1-10), but in a different spirit from cc. 13-14,
the Arabs (xxi. 11 f., 13-17), Tyre (c. 23), and
one with the mysterious (editorial) title
"Burden of the Valley of Vision" (xxii. 1-14).
The last-named, in the form of a vision, depicts
a crisis in the history of Jerusalem, and condemns
the frivolous behaviour of its inhabitants
on the eve of a siege or, as some think,
during the respite given by a temporary raising
of a siege. It was probably uttered by Isaiah
at an early stage in Hezekiah's revolt against
Sennacherib (704 or 703 <small>B.C.</small>), before the actual
appearance of the Assyrian army. The oracle
against Tyre (Isa. xxiii. 1-14&mdash;what follows
is a later supplement) seems more appropriate
to the thirteen years' siege by Nebuchadnezzar
than to the operations of Shalmanezer
or of Sennacherib in Isaiah's days.</p>

<p>Thus Isa. 13-23, like cc. 1-12, contains
prophecies of Isaiah from both the earliest
and the latest period of his activity, intermingled
with others having a totally different
historical horizon and dating from a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
later time, and to both additions have been
made by editors or scribes. A very interesting
example of the latter phenomenon is
Isa. xix. 18 ff. The passage is, in all probability,
from the time of the Greek kingdoms
of Egypt and Syria, the name of the city in
the Greek Bible, "City of Righteousness,"
referring to Leontopolis, where a Jewish
temple was erected about 170 <small>B.C.</small>, with high
priests of the legitimate line exiled from
Jerusalem. "City of Destruction" (<i>heres</i>)
in the Hebrew text is a hostile perversion,
possibly by way of another reading "City of
the Sun" (<i>heres</i>).</p>

<p>Each of the three large prophetic books has
such a group of oracles about gentile nations,
Isa. 13-23; Jer. 46-51; Ezek. 25-32. They
are in part levelled at the immediate neighbours
of Judah, in part against the great
powers, Babylon and Egypt. Many of them
are in such general terms&mdash;or, if they refer
to specific events and situations, our knowledge
of the history is so incomplete&mdash;that it
is peculiarly difficult to fix their age. It was
also a kind of prophecy which peculiarly
invited imitation. Under the foreign yoke
the Jews wore for so many centuries, it must
often have been a relief of soul to repeat
what God was going to do to the heathen; the
spirit of the author of Jonah was not for everybody.
Moreover, if there is any place in the
Old Testament where it would be easier than
another for oracles of the "false prophets"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to slip in and be preserved, it is in these
collections; about the doom of the enemies of
Israel they were as orthodox and as emphatic
as the best. It is not strange, therefore, that
there should be more than usual uncertainty
about the origin of these anathemas on the
gentiles.</p>

<p>Isaiah 24-27 contains a series of prophecies
of judgment to come which differ from others
in the book in having no particular address.
The vision seems to widen to a judgment of
the world, in which the earth itself reels and
sinks under the weight of men's sin, and the
celestial powers (the heavenly bodies, which
are the tutelary deities of the heathen) and
the kings of the earth are cast into the pit
and shut up in prison, while the Lord of Hosts
reigns gloriously in Zion. In another passage
God, with his great sword, punishes the leviathan,
the swift and winding serpent, and slays
the great dragon in the sea. The mythological
eschatology of Judaism made much of such
imagery, which is itself doubtless of mythical
ancestry.</p>

<p>The diction and style of these chapters
alone would suffice to acquit Isaiah of responsibility
for them; anything more unlike his
writing could not be imagined. The author,
whosoever he was, riots in plays on words,
many of them, as is the fate of laborious
punsters, forced or far-fetched. As to the
age of the chapters, apart from the language,
prophecy is here plainly making the transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to apocalypse with those visionary revelations
of the last judgment in which Jewish invention
was so fertile. This of itself points to a late
time in the post-exilic period. The historical
allusions which have been scented out in the
chapters are too uncertain to reckon with;
only, as in c. 19, the way in which Egypt and
Assyria (or Syria) are conjoined seems plainly
to point to the divisions of Alexander's
empire.</p>

<p>In chapters 28-33 are brought together a
number of oracles of Isaiah from the years of
Hezekiah's revolt and Sennacherib's punitive
expedition. These oracles are generally brief
and pointed; they agree in form and spirit
with his prophecies in cc. 1-12 quite as closely
as the writing of an aging man ordinarily
resembles that of his youth. In xxviii. 1-4,
indeed, an early prophecy against Samaria
is made to serve as text for a counterpart
addressed to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Mingled with these is a series of passages
which foretell the destruction of the foe
and the miraculous escape of Judah from
imminent ruin, or, taking higher flight, picture
the golden age to come. To the former
class belong, for example, xxx. 27-33; xxxi.
4-9; to the latter, xxix. 18-24; xxx. 18-26;
xxxii. 1-8, 16-20; while c. 33 partakes of
both characters. That Isaiah predicted the
deliverance of Jerusalem in the last extremity
is reported also in Kings, and need not be
questioned (see also Isa. x. 5-14; xiv. 24-27).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Most of the prophecies of the golden age are,
however, alien to their context, and the unmediated
transition from the unsparing predictions
of judgment to these messianic idylls
makes them suspicious. It is not to be believed
that the prophet thus took the sting out of
his most pungent oracles, but the position of
the passages in question can have no other
intention. If, then, these are utterances of
Isaiah at all, they cannot have been spoken in
their present connection. Some of them, at
least, are much more likely by other hands.
This is true most evidently of c. 33, which was
probably once the end of this little book of
prophecies from the time of Sennacherib
(Isa. 28-33).</p>

<p>Isaiah 34 is a prophecy against all the
nations, which at once concentrates itself upon
Edom, and is remarkable for its rancour, in
which, as in other respects, it resembles cc. 13 f.
The supernatural features of the judgment
remind us also of Isa. 27: it is too little that
the people are annihilated, its very land is
turned into an uninhabitable waste, and, as by
some prodigious volcanic convulsion, its dust
becomes brimstone and its soil burning pitch.
This is the Lord's vengeance for the wrong of
Zion. The cause of this unusual passion is
known from other prophets (see Obad. vss.
10-12; Ezek. xxv. 12-14; c. 35): in the life
and death struggle against Nebuchadnezzar,
the Edomites, Judah's next neighbours and
near kin, had been on the side of the Babylonians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and were the chief gainers by the
ruin of Judah, occupying permanently the
whole south of the country to a line north of
Hebron, making good in this way the part of
their own old territory which had been taken
by the Nabatæans. The injury was lasting
and the hatred durable, but the flaming passion
of Isa. 34 would incline us to think that
it was written while the grief was still fresh.
The pendant to this, Isa. 35, a prophecy of the
return of the dispersion and restoration of
Zion, is quite in the manner of Isa. 40 ff.,
and not improbably by the same author.</p>

<p>Of Isa. 36-39 (2 Kings 18-20) account has
already been given (see above, pp. 112 f.).</p>

<p>There remains the anonymous prophetic
book, Isa. 40-66, which not only has no title,
but in which&mdash;in striking contrast to the frequency
with which Isaiah's name occurs in the
earlier chapters of the book&mdash;no prophet's
name appears.</p>

<p>It begins with the announcement that the
Jews have now been sufficiently punished for
their sins; their guilt has been expiated by
suffering. The hour of national restoration is
at hand. God has already called the deliverer,
who will bring low the pride of Babylon and
set free captive Israel; by his edict Jerusalem
shall be rebuilt and the temple restored. The
Jews, not only from Babylonia but from the
wide and distant lands of their dispersion,
shall flock back to their own country, the
cities of Judah shall be repeopled, and Zion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
shall be too strait for its inhabitants. The
deliverer is Cyrus (Isa. xliv. 28; xlv. 1), who
is called God's friend, his anointed one (messiah);
the victories he has already gained have
been won in the might of Jehovah, who, all
unknown to him, girds him for the battle, and
will go before him to new conquests.</p>

<p>The prophet's prediction was met with
incredulity; the power of Babylon seemed
invincible, the resurrection of the dead nation
impossible. Impossible, maybe, to men, but
not to the Almighty God, the creator of heaven
and earth, the sovereign ruler of the nations!
As surely as the words of former prophets
have come true, so signally shall these foretellings
be fulfilled. For history is the unfolding
of God's plan from the beginning,
which he reveals by chapters to his servants
the prophets.</p>

<p>That this prophecy was delivered by Isaiah
of Jerusalem, a century before the fall of
Judah and a century and a half before the
time of Cyrus, would never have entered
anybody's head had these chapters not been
appended to a roll which bore at its beginning
the name of Isaiah and contained many oracles
of the eighth-century prophet. But this
physical fact, which may be due to no intention
more profound than a desire to economize
writing material, cannot count against the conclusive
internal evidence; background and
foreground in Isa. 40 ff. are not merely totally
different from those of the prophecies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Isaiah and his contemporaries, they are alike
inconceivable in his age. Nor is the fact that
the Jews in New Testament times, including
the New Testament writers, quoted these
chapters as Isaiah and believed him the
author of them, prove anything except that
such was the opinion of the Jews in that age.</p>

<p>The historical situation in Isa. 40 ff. would
of itself be conclusive against Isaiah's authorship;
but it is not the only proof of the contrary.
The author of these chapters has not
inappropriately been called the theologian
among the prophets. His idea of God is conspicuously
more advanced than that of the
prophets of the eighth century; it lies in the
same line with the monotheism of Deuteronomy
and Jeremiah, but lies beyond them.
And it is characteristic that, in contrast to the
older prophets, this one reasons about it. He
argues the omnipotence of God in history from
his omnipotence in creation, and makes large
use of the evidence from the fulfilment of
prophecy to prove that Jehovah is the only
God; he can predict because he foreordains
and brings to pass. With him begins the
polemic, not against the worship of heathen
gods, but against their existence. What the
heathen bow down to are naught but helpless,
senseless idols, the work of their own
hands. He is fond of inviting his readers to an
image-maker's shop to see how a god is made
(see, e.g., Isa. xliv. 9-20). Such are the
impotent gods that the Babylonians expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to save them out of the hands of the creator
of the world!</p>

<p>The style of Isa. 40 ff. is not less decisive.
Translation necessarily in large measure
effaces the differences, but even in translation
a comparison of two passages on similar
themes such as Isa. x. 5-19 and Isa. 47 may
perhaps give some impression of them. The
style of Isaiah and his contemporaries&mdash;Amos,
Hosea, Micah&mdash;is concise and pregnant,
the sentences are short and have often an
oracular ring. The author of Isa. 40 ff.
writes with a freer pen in flowing periods;
he develops his thought and his figures more
at large; if he is obscure, it is seldom from
compression. Here again, Deuteronomy and
Jeremiah, the whole literature of the seventh
century, is an intermediate stage. The later
author is a poet, as Isaiah is, but with other
themes and in other forms; compare, e.g.,
Isa. 5 with Isa. xlii. 1-9. In short, each has a
highly characteristic style, and the two are
totally different.</p>

<p>The historical situation, as it has been
defined above, appears most distinctly in
Isa. 40-55. In the following chapters two
passages were long ago seen not to correspond
to that situation, viz. lvi. 9-lvii. 13 and c. 65
(especially vss. 1-16), in which the vehement
attack on idolatrous and abominable rites
practised by Jews under the prophet's eyes
was thought to indicate a pre-exilic origin.
It was a serious error, however, to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that the so-called exile cured all the Jews once
and for all of every inclination to heathenism;
the history of the Seleucid period sufficiently
proves the contrary. There is nothing in the
chapters inconsistent with the view, now
generally entertained, that these flaming
denunciations were delivered in Palestine in
the Persian or the Greek period; and there
is no warrant for assuming that they were
specifically addressed to the half-heathen
population of the old territory of Israel, still
less to the so-called Samaritan sect, that is,
the worshippers at the rival temple on
Gerizim.</p>

<p>Other chapters (Isa. lvii. 14-21; 60; 61 f.)
resemble in spirit and manner the prophecies
in Isa. 40-55, but are more probably by later
writers under the influence of those prophecies
than by their author. Their optimism contrasts
with the depressed tone of lviii. 1-lix.
15<small><sup>a</sup></small>, in which the sense of sin is borne in on
the community by the delay in the coming of
the good times. In lix. 15<small><sup>b</sup></small>-21, and lxiii.
1-6 God's fury is poured out on foreign nations,
in the latter specifically on Edom; lxiii.
7-lxiv. 12 is a cry for God's intervention in
dire distress (see lxiii. 18; lxiv. 10 f., devastation
of Judah, burning of the temple);
c. 66 contains diverse elements, consolation
to Jerusalem of the school of Isa. 40-45,
and censures of abominable rites (lxvi. 3 f.,
17 ff.).</p>

<p>Isaiah 56-66 is, therefore, generally regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
as an appendix to the book of consolation,
cc. 40-55, containing very diverse elements.</p>

<p>It would be nothing strange if alien prophecies
and editorial expansions were found in
Isa. 40-55 also, and displacements are probably
in more than one passage. The question
of authorship is of peculiar interest in the case
of three prophecies which have for their subject
the mission and suffering of the "Servant
of Jehovah," Isa. xlii. 1-9; xlix. 1-13;
lii. 13-liii. 12, which are thought by some to be
taken wholly or in part from an older prophet,
by others to be later insertions. The reasons
for ascribing the "Servant" passages to a
different author do not seem decisive.</p>

<p>The Book of Isaiah is thus a great collection
of prophecies of various ages, from the
middle of the eighth century B.C. down perhaps
to the third, with some minor additions
of even later date.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>JEREMIAH</h3>


<p>Jeremiah dates his call to the arduous mission
of prophet in the thirteenth year of King
Josiah (626 <small>B.C.</small>), and he lived till after the fall
of Jerusalem in 586 <small>B.C.</small>, so that, like his predecessor
Isaiah a century earlier, his career
spans a period of about forty years in a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of great events. Only five years after he
began to prophesy, Josiah reformed religion
in Judah on the new model of the law-book
discovered by Hilkiah (Deuteronomy; see
above, pp. 62 f.). Jeremiah, scion of a
priestly family native in Anathoth, a few
miles north of Jerusalem, which very likely
traced its descent from Abiathar, David's
priest, whom Solomon deposed in favour of
Zadok, was therefore one of those priests
of the high places who were hit hardest by
the suppression of the local sanctuaries. That
his townsmen of Anathoth sought his life
(Jer. xi. 18 ff.) has been attributed to their
indignation that Jeremiah should dare to
preach Josiah's "covenant" to them (see
Jer. xi. 1-17). Whatever hopes he may have
entertained at first, Jeremiah was not long
in seeing that the reform had cleaned only
the outside of the cup and the platter, while
men fortified their consciences behind the
"covenant" against an investigation of the
inside. In 608 <small>B.C.</small> Josiah fell in battle at
Megiddo against the Egyptian king Necho.
After a brief vassalage to Egypt, Judah came
under the Babylonian yoke. Jeremiah saw
all this; saw, too, Jerusalem twice taken by
the armies of Nebuchadnezzar (597, 586 <small>B.C.</small>),
the temple burned and the walls razed; and
was at last forced to accompany the refugees
to Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah.</p>

<p>Early in the reign of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah
delivered himself of a fulminant oracle in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
gate of the temple (Jer. vii. 1-15, cf. c. 26), in
which he declared that the Jews' faith in the
temple as the palladium of the city was a
delusion; unless they altogether amended
their ways, God would make the temple a ruin
like the ancient sanctuary at Shiloh. Priests,
prophets, and people clamoured with one
voice for the blasphemer's death, but he
hurled back at them a reiteration of his
warning. The intervention of some of the
magnates saved his life; but another prophet
who lacked such influential protection was
extradited from Egypt and put to death.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Jeremiah took
another way of reaching the public (see Jer.
36). He dictated to Baruch the prophecies
which he had uttered from the beginning of
his mission to that time, and sent Baruch to
read the roll in the temple at the fast in the
ninth month in the fifth year of Jehoiakim
(603 <small>B.C.</small>). Some of the nobles had Baruch
give them a private reading, and then carried
the book to the king, first giving Baruch the
friendly advice to put himself and Jeremiah
out of harm's way. The king, as he read the
roll, cut off the pages, and burned them on the
brazier in his chamber. Jeremiah thereupon
dictated to the faithful Baruch another roll
containing all the prophecies that were in the
first, "and there were added besides unto
them many like words." We may be sure
that the second edition would have been
even less agreeable reading to Jehoiakim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
than the first. One of the additional words
is indeed preserved in Jer. xxxvi. 29-31. The
chapter is of peculiar interest, because it is
an account&mdash;the only one in the Old Testament&mdash;of
the origin of a prophetic book. We
see the prophet reproducing, doubtless from
memory, the content of oracles uttered in the
course of the preceding twenty years or more,
and enlarging the collection for a second edition.
It is a fair conjecture that this second
roll furnished to our Book of Jeremiah most,
if not all, the prophecies prior to the fifth year
of Jehoiakim; but it is certain that the roll
itself is not incorporated as such in the present
book. There are also several prophecies from
later years of Jehoiakim, and many from the
reign of the last king, Zedekiah, especially
from the time of his revolt and the siege of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the Book of Jeremiah
is the presence of passages of considerable
extent derived from a biographical source.
From this comes the account of the making
and reading of the collected volume of prophecies
in the fourth and fifth years of
Jehoiakim of which we have already spoken
(Jer. 36), and particularly the narrative of
Jeremiah's fortunes during the last siege
of Jerusalem and afterward, including the
flight to Egypt and his experiences with the
refugees there, covering thus three or four
years beginning with 588 (Jer. 37-44). To
the same source it is natural to ascribe c. 26,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
relating to the circumstances and consequences
of the prophecy delivered in the temple at
the beginning of Jehoiakim's reign (c. 7);
c. 28 (collision with the "false prophet"
Hananiah, in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah); c. 29 (letter to the Jews in Babylonia,
about the same time); and parts of
cc. 32, 34, and 35.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that the
author of this biography was Baruch, who not
only stood in intimate relations with Jeremiah
before the fall of Jerusalem, but accompanied
him to Egypt (Jer. xliii. 6). It is consequently
a historical source of the best possible kind.
For the first half of Jeremiah's career this
source fails us; and, as we have seen, it is continuous
only from the last years of Zedekiah.
It is possible that Baruch's association with
Jeremiah began in the time of Jehoiakim, and
his narrative may have commenced there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this life of Jeremiah has not
been preserved complete or intact. The
prophecies contained in it led later compilers
to introduce other oracles which seemed
appropriate to the context, and to supplement
the words of Jeremiah by edifying compositions
of their own. Their aim, it must constantly
be borne in mind, was not to produce
a critical edition of the prophecies of Jeremiah,
but to make a book effective to impress the
truths and motives of religion on their own
contemporaries, and with changing times and
situations to keep the book, so to speak, up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to date. If the words of an old prophet
suggested to them a good moral, they wrote
it out for him, without dreaming that they were
doing either him or morality a wrong, or
thinking how much trouble they were making
for future historical students. It is exactly
the same procedure and the same motive which
meets us in innumerable places in the Pentateuch
and Historical Books. To stigmatize
such interpolations as literary fraud is absurd.
These additions are often recognizable by
their prosaic preachiness or by their composite
imitativeness.</p>

<p>Of one kind of prediction the Jews of later
centuries could not have enough, the prophecies
of deliverance from the foreign yoke
and the better time to follow. They not only
cherished the hopeful words of former prophets
and wrote variations on their themes, but gave
expression to their faith and their ideals in
their own way. That they often took their
inspiration from Isa. 40 ff. is natural. In
Jeremiah such promises of a happier future
are accumulated in cc. 30-33, which contain,
with some oracles of Jeremiah, pieces of various
authorship and age, some of them such pendants
to gloomy pictures as we have found
numerous in Isaiah (e.g. Jer. xxx. 1 ff. to
vss. 12-15), others more independent compositions.</p>

<p>These stand interspersed among the extracts
from Baruch's life of Jeremiah. In the first
half of the book (Jer. 1-25) there is no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
history for a framework. It will be observed
here that the prophet commonly introduces
his message in personal form, "The word of
Jehovah came to me, saying," or "Then
Jehovah said to me," or the like. Sometimes
an oracle begins, as in c. 18, "The words
which came to Jeremiah," as a kind of title,
while in the sequel the prophet speaks in
the first person. Dates are infrequent in
this part of the book, and if a chronological
order was observed in Baruch's roll, it has
been broken up in the present arrangement.
Internal evidence does not always suffice to fix
the age of the utterances, the less because
some of the early oracles have obviously
been adapted to a later situation. This is
peculiarly evident in cc. 1-6. In these
chapters are several prophecies from the years
when the wild horsemen from the Scythian
steppes were overrunning western Asia and
striking terror into the stoutest hearts by
their barbarous appearance and fierce manners.
Jeremiah saw in them the scourge of God (see
e.g. Jer. iv. 5-8, 27-31), the day of doom was
come! It was, indeed, such a vision of doom
that first met his gaze, when God made him
a prophet (Jer. i. 13 ff.). But in the present
shape of these chapters the enemy out of the
north which menaces ruin is not the wild
Scythian hordes, but the serried armies of
Babylon. It is not at all improbable that
this change of horizon was made by Jeremiah
himself, when at the beginning of Jehoiakim's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
reign the Scythian flood had run off, and, by
the overthrow of Nineveh and Nebuchadnezzar's
defeat of Pharaoh Necho on the
Euphrates, the new Babylonian empire had
become the impending fate of Syria and
Palestine.</p>

<p>Among the prophecies of Jeremiah in this
part of the book also are introduced pieces,
larger or smaller, which are the product of
later generations; two conspicuous examples
are Jer. ix. 23-34; x. 1-16 (x. 17 is the immediate
continuation of ix. 22), and xvii. 19-27.</p>

<p>Jeremiah's experience in the pursuit of his
calling was a hard one. His Cassandra forebodings
gained him the enmity of all, and
hostility grew to bitter hatred as the dire
fulfilment stared them in the face. His
countrymen in Anathoth plotted his death;
the prophecy in the temple all but cost him his
life, and was an end, for the time at least, of
public appearances; the coming of his collected
oracles into Jehoiakim's hands drove him and
the scribe into hiding. During the last siege,
he first was kept in arrest in a private house,
then cast into an empty cistern, where he
would have perished but for the friendliness
of a negro eunuch; then confined in the
court of the guard till the taking of the city;
released by the Babylonians, his counsel to
the refugees not to flee to Egypt was badly
received, and he was constrained to accompany
them. In Egypt, again denouncing
and predicting ill, he disappears; Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
legend says, killed by his exasperated countrymen.</p>

<p>But these outward perils and pains were not
all he had to bear for being a prophet. In
anguish of soul he suffered twice the tragedy
of his people, in foresight and in fact&mdash;suffered
as only a man of sensitive spirit and unflinching
will can suffer. That needs no commentary;
but there is another element we do not so
easily conceive: Jeremiah believed that the
word of God he had to utter was not merely
a prediction, but the effectual cause, of the
ruin of Judah (see Jer. i. 9 f.). It is not
strange that the task God had laid on him
seemed too heavy to be borne. He feels
himself a man of contention to the whole earth.
He remonstrates, he reproaches God for having
misled him, he resolves never again to speak
in the name of the Lord; but there is within
him as it were a burning fire shut up in his
bones, he cannot hold in (Jer. xx. 7-18;
see also xv. 10 f., 15-18; xii. 1-6). These
"confessions," as they have been called,
are of the greatest interest; they are a revelation
of the prophet's soul such as has no
counterpart in the Old Testament, and, with
Baruch's simple story, bring him as a man
nearer to us than any of the other prophets.</p>

<p>In the Hebrew (and therefore in the English)
Bible, the last chapters of the book (Jer.
46-51) contain a collection of prophecies
against foreign nations, to which is appended
(c. 52) an extract from the Book of Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
(2 Kings xxiv. 18-xxv. 21), describing the
taking of Jerusalem by the Babylonian army
in 586 <small>B.C.</small> In the Greek Bible the oracles
against the foreign nations come in between
Jer. xxv. 13 and vs. 15, but in an altogether
different order. They evidently formed a little
book by themselves, which in one recension
of the Book of Jeremiah were appended to
the volume of his prophecies, in another were
inserted in the middle of it as the corresponding
collections of foreign oracles are
placed in Ezek. 25-32 and Isa. 13-23. The
question of the original place and disposition
of these prophecies is of importance only for
the relation of the two forms of the book to
each other, and need not be pursued here.</p>

<p>It is very doubtful whether Jeremiah had
any hand whatever in these chapters. The
prolix prophecy against Babylon (Jer. 50-51)
is a purely literary exercise, for which contributions
have been levied right and left, and
was written at a time when Babylon had long
ceased to be of historical importance. Others
of the prophecies borrow from earlier prophets
generously. An examination, by the aid of
the marginal references in the Revised Version
(Oxford and Cambridge edition, 1898), of
the appropriations and reminiscences will
give a profitable notion of this literary imitation
of prophecy.</p>

<p>The different order of the prophecies is not
the only, nor the most important, difference
between the Hebrew and the Greek Jeremiah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Besides a great number of variant readings of
the ordinary kind, the oldest Greek version
is much shorter than the Hebrew; it has
been reckoned that in the neighbourhood of
2700 words in the latter have nothing corresponding
to them in the translation. Some
part of this may be due to abridgment by the
translators, to which the repetitions in parts of
Jeremiah&mdash;chiefly secondary parts&mdash;invited;
but when all allowance is made for this, it
remains that the Hebrew copies from which
the translation was made had a much briefer
text than the Palestinian Hebrew in our hands,
and it is probable that the greater part of this
difference, which is chiefly in comparative
verbosity, is due to padding with stock phrases
and turns of thought in the Palestinian text.
In some instances oracles or tags to oracles
which on other grounds are recognized as late
additions to our text had not got into that of
the Greek translators.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>EZEKIEL</h3>


<p>Ezekiel was one of the priests of Jerusalem
who was carried off to Babylonia with King
Jehoiachin in the deportation of 597 <small>B.C.</small>
Those who were thus deported were the upper
classes, including, of course, the royal family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and the court and the aristocracy of the priesthood,
and skilled artisans, particularly the
smiths (armorers). Having thus removed
the natural leaders of the rebellious people,
Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah, an uncle of
Jehoiachin, king in his stead and gave Judah
another trial. The eight or ten thousand
Jews with their families who were removed
to Babylonia were colonized at different points,
Ezekiel repeatedly mentions the river Chebar,
that is, probably, the grand canal in the
vicinity of Nippur. The patricians in exile
thought very poorly of the new lords who had
stepped into their shoes in Jerusalem, and
they flattered themselves that events would
soon take such a turn that they would return
to Judæa and to power. They had prophets
and diviners among them who encouraged
them in this expectation. When Zedekiah
revolted and the Babylonian armies a second
time besieged Jerusalem, their faith in the
inviolability of Zion, confirmed, rather than
shaken, by the outcome of things in 597 B.C.,
when Jehoiachin surrendered and the holy
city took no harm, made them refuse hearing
to Ezekiel's prediction of ruin; they may
even have dreamed that Nebuchadnezzar
would find out his mistake and restore to
Judah its legitimate rulers, chastened by
experience, and pack Zedekiah and his
advisers into exile in their place.</p>

<p>Against this vain and superstitious optimism
Ezekiel had to contend until the disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
issue made a rude end of all their
dreams and threw the exiles into the depths
of hopelessness: Bel had triumphed over
Jehovah, and it was all over with the nation.
Thenceforth Ezekiel's task was to save them
from despair by the assurance that God
still had a purpose to fulfil with them, and
that, in his own time, when they had been
thoroughly purged from their old sins and
filled with a new spirit, he would restore them
to their own land and bring to life again the
dead nation.</p>

<p>These two periods of the prophet's mission
sharply divide the Book of Ezekiel. To the
day when the word came to him that the
Babylonian armies had invested Jerusalem
(Ezek. 24) he combats delusion; from the
arrival of the tidings of the fall of the city
(xxxiii. 21 ff.) he combats despair. The first
part is all menace, the second is full of promise.
Numerous dated oracles serve as landmarks,
especially in the first part.</p>

<p>Between the two, in the two years of suspense,
when about his own people the prophet
is dumb, is placed the group of prophecies
against foreign nations (cc. 25-32), beginning
with oracles against the neighbours of Judah
who held true to Nebuchadnezzar in this
crisis and had their reward at Judah's cost&mdash;Ammonites,
Moabites, Edomites, and Philistines.
These are followed by long predictions
of the ruin of Tyre, over whose calamity
the prophet exults more loudly than the grievance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of Jerusalem (Ezek. xxvi. 2) seems to
justify. Nebuchadnezzar did in fact besiege
Tyre for thirteen years (585-572 <small>B.C.</small>), and
doubtless inflicted upon it great losses; but
the island city, with its command of the sea,
he could not take. Ezekiel himself, in a remarkable
passage which is perhaps his latest
word in the book, admits that his predictions
of the capture of Tyre (xxvi. 7-14) had not
been fulfilled&mdash;Nebuchadnezzar had had to
raise the long and ineffectual siege&mdash;but he
promises that Jehovah will reward him
for these fruitless labours in the Lord's service
by giving him Egypt instead (xxix. 17-21).
The animosity against Egypt which finds
expression in the predictions of the Babylonian
subjugation of that country is more
easily explained. Egypt had been the evil
genius of Judah, instigating rebellion against
the Babylonian suzerainty, and promising
armed aid which always failed in the decisive
hour; it was meet that it should taste the
cup of humiliation itself. In c. 32 the descent
of Egypt to the hell of fallen nations is vividly
depicted; a similar picture of the descent of
the Babylonian king in Isa. 14 has already
been noted. Not improbably Babylonian
notions of the nether world may have influenced
the imagery of both, as a myth of paradise
seems to have suggested the imagery of
Tyre in Eden (xxviii. 12 ff.). Outside this
group is an oracle against Edom (c. 35),
and the great prophecy of the irruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Gog and his hordes and their fate
(cc. 38 f.).</p>

<p>A conspicuous feature of the Book of
Ezekiel are the extended visions and the
elaborated symbolical actions. In the inaugural
vision (Ezek. i.-iii. 15), for instance,
God appears, a veritable <i>deus ex machina</i>,
on a high seat in a curious motor car made up
of animated wheels and winged monsters.
In a later vision (c. 10) he sees God leave the
doomed temple in Jerusalem and mount this
cherubim car, in which he is whirled away
through the air to the east; and in the great
vision of the new temple in the golden age
God returns to his abode in the same conveyance
(c. 43). Striking examples of symbolical
actions may be found in Ezek. 4, and in xii.
1-20. They are of such an extraordinary
character as to raise the question whether
they were really enacted before the eyes of
the people or only described in discourse.</p>

<p>Ezekiel's visions are sometimes ecstatic
states, in which he is instantaneously translated
from place to place. At the end of the
inaugural vision, "the spirit" lifted him up
and took him away, setting him down in
amazement among the colonists at Tell-Abib.
In viii. 1 ff., as he sat in his own house
in the midst of a company of the elders of
Judah, the spirit, which is described as a
strange luminous creature, took him up by
the hair of his head and wafted him "in the
visions of God" to Jerusalem, where his conductor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
showed him all the idolatrous cults
and the abominable mysteries that were
practised in the temple under the very eyes of
"the glory of the God of Israel" (c. 8); after
seeing God take his flight from the desecrated
sanctuary, the prophet is translated by the
spirit to Chaldæa again. Another such vision
in ecstasy is the famous scene in the valley of
dry bones (Ezek. 37). In such cases it is
impossible to say how much is actually the
experience of the visionary, how much literary
form.</p>

<p>In the great vision of the restoration, cc. 40-48,
which also is introduced as an ecstasy with
the translation of the prophet to Palestine, we
may be pretty sure that the element of conscious
composition predominates. The chapters
contain a programme for the coming age
when all the twelve tribes, gathered together
from exile and dispersion, shall reoccupy the
holy land, with a new, geometrical division of
the territory, with a new plan for the city of
Jerusalem, a new constitution for the state,
a new temple after the old model, a reorganized
ministry of religion, and a reformed worship.
The ruling idea which runs through all is to
make impossible those sins against the holiness
of God, his land, his house, his people,
which had been the cause of former ruin.</p>

<p>The Book of Ezekiel seems to have been
arranged and published by the author, and
though some derangements and repetitions
may be observed, it has not been much meddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with by later editors, and, to whatever
reason it may be attributed, exhibits none of
the phenomena of compilation and amplification
which we have found in Isaiah and Jeremiah.
The Hebrew text, however, has
suffered more than most books in transmission,
and has reached us in an unusually corrupt
state. The author has a style of his own,
which can rise to eloquence (as in the oracles
against Tyre), but is generally pedestrian and
sometimes clumsy. He has plenty of imagination,
not always regulated by taste or
restrained by decency. His drastic figures
of the unfaithfulness of Israel and Judah
are often unfit to translate.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DANIEL</h3>


<p>In the Hebrew Bible the Book of Daniel
stands, not as in our Bible among the
Prophets, after Ezekiel, but among the miscellaneous
books in the third division, the
"Scriptures." Various reasons have been suggested
for this, but by far the most probable
is that at the time when Daniel became current,
in the second century <small>B.C.</small>, the Prophets
were already a definite group of writings with
a traditional use in the readings of the Synagogue,
to which a new book could not well
be added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>The Book of Daniel consists of two parts,
stories about Daniel and his three comrades
(cc. 1-6), and visions of Daniel (cc. 7-12); in
the latter Daniel reports his visions in the
first person as Ezekiel habitually does, and it
was only natural that he should be taken for
the author of the book.</p>

<p>According to the introduction to the first
story, Daniel and his three friends, Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah, were Jewish youths of
high birth who were carried captive to Babylon
by Nebuchadnezzar in the first deportation
(which is erroneously dated in the third
year of Jehoiakim). One story (Dan. 1)
tells how these youths contrived to avoid all
danger of eating unclean food, and how God
blessed them in body and mind for their
scrupulousness in observance of the dietary
laws; another (c. 3), how the three were
saved from Nebuchadnezzar's overheated furnace,
into which they were thrown for refusing
to worship the idol; a third (c. 6), how Daniel
was cast into the lions' den for praying to his
God despite the edict of Darius. These
miraculous deliverances constrain the heathen
kings publicly to acknowledge that the God of
the Jews is the greatest of gods. The same
acknowledgment is drawn from Nebuchadnezzar
when Daniel recalls his forgotten dream
and interprets it, after all the diviners of
Babylon had failed (c. 2); he alone is able to
decipher and explain for Belshazzar the handwriting
on the wall (c. 5). The stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Nebuchadnezzar's madness (c. 2) and of Belshazzar's
feast (c. 5) teach also how God
punishes kings who in their pride of power
exalt themselves before him, or in their arrogance
profane his holy things.</p>

<p>All of them thus magnify the God of the
Jews as in power and wisdom above all other
gods, and two of the most striking of them
have for their theme the deliverance from
mortal peril of men who stood faithful to their
religion against the king's commandment.
These obvious motives, as we shall presently
see, have a bearing on the age of the stories.</p>

<p>In the second part of the book are four
visions, or revelations, which stand in chronological
order (according to the author's
chronology): c. 7 in the first year of Belshazzar;
c. 8 in his third year; c. 9 in the first
year of "Darius son of Xerxes, of the race of
the Medes"&mdash;not properly a vision, but a
revelation by Gabriel; and cc. 10-12 in the
third year of Cyrus, king of Persia. By the
side of these must be put Nebuchadnezzar's
dream in Dan. ii. 28-45 (second year of Nebuchadnezzar),
which, in its four-empire scheme,
corresponds to Daniel's vision in c. 7. The
interpretations which Daniel gives to Nebuchadnezzar
or the angel gives to Daniel,
though sometimes surrounded with an impressive
air of mystery, give all the necessary clues
to the understanding of the visions, and
obscure allusions are often made plain by a
more explicit parallel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Under fantastic and varied imagery, they
unroll the history of the empires which
succeed one another in the dominion of the
world, from the Babylonian (Dan. 2 and
7), or the Medo-Persian (c. 8), or Persian
(cc. 10-12)&mdash;that is from the assumed standpoint
of Daniel&mdash;through the dominion of
Alexander and the kingdoms into which his
empire was broken up, ending always with
the reign of Antiochus IV. (175-164 <small>B.C.</small>).
The goal in them all is the destruction of
the heathen power and the establishment
of the eternal kingdom of the holy people of
the Most High, otherwise, the Jews.</p>

<p>The simplest form of this scheme is Nebuchadnezzar's
dream in Dan. 2. The image
with head of gold, breast and arms of silver,
belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and
feet part of iron and part of clay, stands for
four empires in a scale of deterioration, like
the four ages of Hesiod, beginning with the
Babylonian, represented by Nebuchadnezzar
himself. This is followed by an inferior kingdom,
and that by a third universal empire;
the destructive strength of the fourth is figured
by iron which shatters all that it smites;
the feet and toes signify a divided kingdom,
in part strong as iron, in part brittle as pottery.
The stone which smote the image on the feet
and broke them to pieces, whereupon the whole
image collapsed into dust and was whirled
away by the wind, while the stone grew to
a great mountain and filled all the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is the kingdom which the God of heaven shall
establish in those days, "which shall never
be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof
be left to another people, but it shall break
in pieces and annihilate all those empires,
and it shall stand forever."</p>

<p>The image thus represents the rule of the
heathen as one world-empire, the dominion
being exercised successively by four kingdoms
and by the divisions of the fourth; in the
destruction of these last the heathen world-empire
is forever annihilated, and the eternal
kingdom of God subdues and rules the whole
earth. What is said about the second and
third kingdoms is too general to identify
them; the iron strength and destructiveness
of the fourth, and its divisions with their
mingled strength and weakness, naturally
suggest Alexander and his successors, and this
impression is strengthened by the one specific
trait in the whole picture; the vain effort
to make iron and wet clay combine signifies,
we are told, an equally futile attempt to bind
the divided kingdoms together by intermarriages
(Dan. ii. 43). We know from the
historians that attempts to ally the kingdoms
of the Ptolemies in Egypt and the Seleucids
in Syria by dynastic marriages were repeatedly
made in vain, and the author of Daniel himself,
in c. 11, refers to these alliances and their
disastrous failure in plain terms.</p>

<p>The vision of Daniel in c. 7 brings in the
four empires under the symbol of four monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
beasts. The fourth, more terrible and
more destructive than the others, has ten
horns ("out of this kingdom ten kings shall
arise," vs. 24); another horn, "with the eyes
of a man and a boastful mouth," arises which
roots out three of the ten. Daniel sees how
he makes war on the "holy men" (i.e. the
Jews) and prevails over them (vs. 21); the
interpreting angel describes in more detail
the crimes of the last king: he will utter
speeches against the Highest, and wear out
the holy men of the Most High, and try to
change (religious) seasons and law (religion).
God's people will be delivered into his power
till the expiration of three and a half years
(cf. xii. 7). Then the proud king and his
kingdom will be annihilated and the universal
and eternal empire of the Jews established.</p>

<p>Still more definite is the description of the
doings of the "little horn" which springs up
on the head of the great he-goat in the vision
of c. 8. Here the interpreter becomes explicit:
the he-goat is by name the Macedonian
empire. The little horn is a king who shall
arise in the latter time of the divided kingdoms
of Alexander's successors. This king magnifies
himself against the chief of the heavenly
host, casts down his sanctuary, takes away
his daily burnt-offerings, and destroys the
holy people; and is then himself suddenly
"broken without hand." In the further
explanation given to Daniel in ix. 26 ff., the
cessation of the daily sacrifice is to last half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a week (of years), i.e. three and a half years;
the profanation of the sanctuary and suppression
of the sacrifices and the persecution
of the Jews occur again in xi. 31 ff. (cf. xii.
5-12). In connection with this we hear of
setting up of a "desolating (or appalling)
abomination," in the temple. The common
use of "abomination" (loathsome thing) for
idols or other objects of heathen worship
leaves no doubt that some such object is
meant here: the king not only stopped the
worship of the God of the Jews in his own
temple, but established in its place a heathen
cult. It is, indeed, not improbable that the
words translated "appalling abomination"
are an intentional distortion of the proper
name of the heathen god Baal Shamaim, i.e.
Jupiter.</p>

<p>The definiteness of all this proves that the
author is not creating an imaginary monster
in whom all the sins of the heathen rulers
against the God of Heaven and his people
are accumulated, but describing a historical
figure. Nor is there the smallest room for
question whose portrait he is painting: every
feature of it belongs to Antiochus IV., Epiphanes
(Manifest God, the title means, which
Antiochian wits perverted to Epimanes, Manifest
Madman), who in 168 <small>B.C.</small> took possession
of the temple in Jerusalem, suppressed
the worship of its God, erected an altar of
Jupiter on the great altar of burnt offering,
and inaugurated heathen sacrifices. Not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that, but he forbade circumcision, the observance
of the sabbath, and the possession of
copies of the scriptures, and commanded that
Jews should certify their abjuration of their
own religion by sacrificing to his gods. Those
who ignored or defied his decrees were persecuted;
many of them put to death. This
attempt to extirpate the Jewish religion and
forcibly heathenize the people provoked a
revolt led by Judas Maccabæus and his
brothers, who three years later recovered the
temple, purged it, and restored the sacrifices.</p>

<p>If there could be any doubt about the
identification, it would be removed by Dan.
11, which, as was recognized by Porphyry in
the third century of our era, contains a minute
history of the relations of the Ptolemies and
Seleucids, their intermarriages and their wars,
with increasing detail, down to the Egyptian
campaigns of Antiochus Epiphanes&mdash;mentioning,
for instance, the rebuff he received
from the Roman envoy (Popillius Laenas),
and in the sequel of this his desecration of the
temple in Jerusalem and persecution of the
law-abiding Jews&mdash;and there the history ends.</p>

<p>All this is supposed to be revealed to Daniel
in the days of Nebuchadnezzar and under
later Babylonian and Median kings down to
the first year of Cyrus, that is, according to
the historical chronology, about three hundred
and seventy-five years before the event.
Such visionary panoramas form a recognized
genus of Jewish literature, and they are regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
unrolled to some man of God in the
remote or remotest past. In the second and
first centuries before our era a great variety
of such visions were attributed to Enoch,
others to Noah; revelations to Seth the son
of Adam were once popular, and Adam himself
had some. Another class, like Daniel,
bore the names of men of the exile; Baruch
is the putative father of several such revelations;
one of the most notable of the kind is
the apocalypse of Ezra, which stands in the
Apocrypha in our Bible as Second Esdras.</p>

<p>The age of such apocalypses is determined,
not by the date assigned to the imaginary
seer, but by the actual standpoint of the
author as disclosed in the visions. In Daniel
the historical panorama is unrolled every
time to the reign of Antiochus IV., and there
stops. The writer had witnessed the desecration
of the temple and the persecution of
the Jews for their religion, he had seen the
first small successes of the Maccabees, but the
recovery of the temple and the restoration of
sacrifice had not yet occurred. The death
of Antiochus is circumstantially predicted,
but in a place and manner very remote from
the reality (Dan. xi. 45). The visions of
Daniel fall, therefore, between December
168 <small>B.C.</small>, the date of the desecration of the
temple, and December 165, the restoration.
The motives of the stories also (see above,
p. 178 f.) are most appropriate to the situation
under Antiochus. It is possible that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
adaptations of older tales, but there is no
reason to think that they are of high antiquity.
The Greek Bible has three additional stories
about Daniel (Susanna and the Elders, Bel,
and the Dragon) which stand in our Bibles
among the Apocrypha.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Book of Daniel
remains for brief mention. Like Ezra, it is
in two languages: Dan. i. 1-ii. 4 is in Hebrew,
from ii. 4 b to the end of c. 7 in Aramaic, and
from the beginning of c. 8 the rest is in Hebrew
again. The Aramaic begins appropriately
where the Chaldæans (diviners) are introduced
speaking in what the author evidently conceives
to be the language of the country;
the text does not, however, revert to Hebrew
when this conference is over, but holds on,
not only through all the rest of the stories,
but through the first vision (c. 7). A motive
for just this distribution of the two tongues
is not discoverable; in the chapter of accidents
are various possibilities which offset
one another. As in Ezra&mdash;though there are
some differences between the two books&mdash;the
Aramaic is of a kind which was vernacular
in Palestine in the last centuries before our
era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>MINOR PROPHETS</h3>


<p>The Minor Prophets&mdash;so called not in depreciation,
but because their books are smaller
than those of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel&mdash;form
in the Jewish Bible one book, in which
are brought together oracles in the name of
various prophets from the eighth century
<small>B.C.</small> (Amos, Hosea) to the fifth (Haggai,
Zechariah), and one anonymous book
(Malachi). As in the collections which bear
in their titles the names of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
so in the collection of the Twelve,
prophecies have been attributed, by error or
conjecture or accident, to prophets to whom
they do not belong, and additions and alterations
have been made by compilers or editors.
The extent of this alien matter differs in
different books; Hosea, for example, seems
to contain little of it, while in Micah it is
considerable.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hosea.</span>&mdash;In our Bibles, in which the Minor
Prophets stand and are counted individually,
the first is Hosea. This position, which it
has also in the Hebrew Bible, may have been
given the book, partly on account of its age,
partly on account of its length; but it might
also claim it by reason of its worth, for Hosea
is one of the greatest of the prophets, not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Minor company alone, but in the canon.
No other contributed so much, through his
own words and through his great successors,
Jeremiah and the Deuteronomists, to deepen
and spiritualize the conception of religion.</p>

<p>Hosea was an Israelite who began to prophesy
to his countrymen in the reign of Jeroboam
II., probably about 750 <small>B.C.</small>, and after
Jeroboam's death witnessed at least the
beginning of that procession of assassinations
and revolutions through which the kingdom
hurried to meet its fate; but it does not appear
from his book that he lived to see the invasion
of Tiglath-Pileser and the loss of Gilead and
Galilee in 734 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> in which his own predictions
of impending doom had so signal a verification.
Their complete fulfilment came in 721, when
Sargon made an end forever of the kingdom of
Israel, and deported many of the people of
Samaria to remote quarters of his empire.</p>

<p>The Book of Hosea opens with chapters out
of the prophet's experience with his unfaithful
wife, in which he sees a counterpart and symbol
of God's experience with Israel. This discovery
of this significance in the tragedy of his
life is what made him a prophet. He saw
then that it was for this he had been led to
marry a woman who turned out a gross adulteress.
When he drove her from his house,
when later he bought her out of the servitude
into which she had sunk, and by seclusion and
a discipline at once firm and kind tried to
win her back by love to virtue, that, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was an apologue of God's dealing with his
people (see specially Hos. i. 2-9; iii. 1-5).
He is the first, apparently, to use the metaphor
adultery, or fornication, for religious defection.
The oracle, ii. 2-23, translates it into its historical
terms and discloses Hosea's construction
of the religious history of Israel. The
root of Israel's apostasy was the belief that
the gods of the soil of Canaan, the baals, gave
the corn and the wine and the oil which in
reality its own God, Jehovah, bestowed.
Therefore he will take away all these, which
she deems the gift of the baals, the wages of
her prostitution, and will lead the people into
the desert of exile. But he will be with them
there to comfort and encourage, and Israel
will return to its first love as in the early
days when it was alone with God in the
desert of the exodus. Then the old relation
will be restored, never to be broken, and the
gifts in the new betrothal are uprightness
and justice and charity and kindness of heart
and faithfulness and the knowledge of God
(Hosea's word for religion). That will be
the golden age! (See Hos. ii. 18-23.)</p>

<p>When the Jew says his <i>Shema</i> or the
Christian his Great Commandment, "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine
heart and with all thy soul and with all thy
might," it is Hosea's great thought he is
repeating. Hosea interprets God's dealing
with his people by his faith in God's inextinguishable
love. Outraged love may smite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
harder than offended righteousness, but its
blows are remedial, not retributive or expiatory;
its aim not to satisfy justice, but to
recover the erring. The exile, which for Amos
is the final vindication of God's righteousness
in the death of the sinful nation, is for Hosea
a chastisement which leads to repentance and
restoration. He is therefore the author of
that ideal of a golden age of godliness and
uprightness and happiness, beyond the impending
judgment or the present oppression,
which is one of the leading motives of the
so-called messianic prophecy.</p>

<p>The rest of the book (cc. 4-14) consists of a
collection of oracles, without titles, and often
without obvious boundaries. They contain
an appalling picture of the sins of the nation as
a whole and of all classes of society; kings
and princes, priests and prophets and people&mdash;all
are corrupt. The theme of the whole
may be read in Hos. iv. 1 f.: "There is no
truth, nor charity, nor knowledge of God
(religion) in the land; naught but swearing
and breaking faith and murder and theft and
adultery." Therefore ruin yawns before the
nation. Yet God will not destroy utterly; all
the pathos of the divine love finds words in
such passages as xi. 8 ff., "How can I give
thee up, Ephraim?" or xiv. 1 ff., "O Israel,
return unto the Lord thy God."</p>

<p>This book of a prophet of the northern
kingdom has come down to us through
Judæan hands; the title, with its list of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Judæan kings (exactly the same as in the title
of Isaiah), is doubtless due to a Jewish editor,
and we are not surprised to find in the text
itself Jewish touches, such as the words "and
David their king" in iii. 5, or i. 11, but these
are not numerous nor important. The text
of Hosea is, however, unusually corrupt.
The prophet's style is very difficult, and scribes
did as they commonly do with a difficult text,
they made mechanical mistakes because they
did not understand and false emendations
because they thought they understood what
they did not.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Joel.</span>&mdash;Joel was probably put between
Hosea and Amos because the editors of the
Book of the Twelve thought that he was
one of the earlier prophets, and, chiefly because
of its position, this opinion has been general
until recent times. In the book itself there
are neither names nor identifiable historical
allusions by which its age can be determined.
The whole situation, however, is that of the
so-called post-exilic times.</p>

<p>The occasion of the prophecy with which
the book begins was a portentous plague of
locusts, whose invasion and ravages are
described in Joel 1-2 in highly poetical
imagery. Locusts and drought together have
so devastated the land that both men and
beasts are perishing, and&mdash;the last touch of
the extremity&mdash;the obligatory daily offerings
in the temple have been cut off. The prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
calls to fasting and supplication; perhaps
God may be entreated to have mercy on them
(ii. 12-17). God had pity on his people;
the following oracle (ii. 18-27) promises relief
and everlasting prosperity. The visitation
seems to the prophet an omen of the dread
"Day of the Lord." He sees the nations
gather beneath the walls of Jerusalem (in
the valley with the ominous name, Jehoshaphat,
"Jehovah judges") for the last onset,
to be annihilated by the intervention of God.
Then the golden age will be ushered in.</p>

<p>The heads of the people are priests and
elders; of king and princes there is no word.
The Judah and Jerusalem which the prophet
addresses are the religious community which
assembles in the temple; people and congregation
are the same thing. This one observation
takes Joel out of the company of Amos and
Hosea and puts him by the side of Malachi.
All the other features of the book confirm
this date. Assyrians or Babylonians, without
whom no picture of the Day of the Lord in
the pre-exilic prophets would be complete,
are not here; Israel has disappeared.</p>

<p>The author has read much prophetic literature;
reminiscences in thought and phrase
meet us at every turn. The heathen in the
Valley of Jehoshaphat are Ezekiel's hordes
of Gog (Ezek. 38 f.); the fountain that flows
from the house of the Lord is a modest
counterpart of the river that sweetens the
Dead Sea (Ezek. 47). The thumb-prints of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
editorial hands have been thought to betray
themselves in several places, and some students
would give a larger range to this observation.
The additions, if such they are, are not far
remote in time from the original book, and
reflect the same religious conceptions.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Amos.</span>&mdash;A dramatic scene in Amos vii.
10-17 describes the appearance of Amos at
Bethel on a high festival, with his presages
of swift and utter ruin for Israel (cf. vii. 1-9).
That his hearers greeted the message with
incredulity can well be believed, for under
Jeroboam II. Israel was at the very culmination
of its power and prosperity. The chief
priest of Bethel was not minded to let such
speech pass in his diocese; as scornfully as
Creon dismisses the prophet Teiresias in the
Antigone, he bids Amos be gone: "O Seer,
be off, flee to the land of Judah; make thy
living there, and there do thy prophesying.
But prophesy no more at Bethel, for it is a
royal temple and a residence city." Spurning
the contemptuous insinuation, Amos answers:
"No prophet am I, and no member of the
prophetic order, but a herdsman am I and
a ripener of sycamore figs. Jehovah took me
from following the flock, and bade me, Go
prophesy against my people Israel." Incidentally
we see in how low esteem the professional
prophet stood, that the priest should
make a taunt of the name and the prophet
indignantly repel it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>The priest followed up his warning by a
report to the king, and we may safely conclude
that Amos prophesied no more at Bethel.
Perhaps it was the rude end of his mission that
prompted him to collect his oracles into a
book, the earliest example of such a collection,
as a witness to his own generation and to that
which should see the fulfilment.</p>

<p>The title, this part of which may well be
original, describes Amos as a shepherd from
Tekoa, in the wilderness of Judah. Beyond
the brief scene at Bethel nothing more is told
of him in the book or out of it. But the book
is his monument.</p>

<p>It is one of the easiest of the prophetic books
to understand and one of the best preserved.
Chapters 1 and 2 contain a series of brief
oracles, on the same plan, against the neighbours
of Israel, the Syrians of Damascus,
the Philistines, Ph&oelig;nicians, Edomites, Ammonites,
Moabites, Judæans, leading up to a
longer indictment of Israel and denunciation
of God's judgment upon it. This is followed
by prophecies against Israel (cc. 3-6), which
seem to be formally divided into three
parts by the introductory formula, "Hear
this word" (iii. 1; iv. 1; v. 1), but by
subject would naturally fall into a larger
number of oracles. Chapter 7 begins with
three visions, the delivery of which at Bethel
may have provoked Amaziah's interference
(vii. 10-17); c. 8 again opens with a vision,
in which the basket of summer fruit <i>(kais)</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is to the prophet a symbol of the coming end
<i>(k&#275;s)</i> of Israel; in c. 9 Amos sees the Lord
standing beside the altar and pronouncing
the word of destruction and inescapable
doom (ix. 1-8<small><sup>a</sup></small>), from which an awkward
transition (ix. 8<small><sup>b</sup></small>-10) carries us to a prediction
of the restoration of David's kingdom and
the prosperity of the golden age.</p>

<p>The doom which Amos sees impending over
Israel is visited upon it in retribution for the
wrongs which men inflict upon their fellows,
the oppression of the poor by the rich, the
small man by the great; the injustice, often
in the forms of law, by which men are deprived
of property and liberty; the luxury, aping
foreign modes, which is not only corrupting
in itself, but is the chief motive of injustice
and oppression and fraud. The very prosperity
of the nation was its ruin.</p>

<p>With all this, Israel is very religious; it
acknowledges the success in war and the
profit of commerce as the gift of the national
God and evidence of his favour, and does not
grudge him his share even of ill-gotten gains.
Amos's God has a conscience&mdash;that was a
new idea about gods!&mdash;and abhors such
religion; he hates their festivals, refuses their
sacrifices, spurns their hymns of praise. "But
let justice roll down like floods, and right
like an unfailing stream." That is the only
worship he owns.</p>

<p>The standard of right is not one thing in
Israel and another among the heathen: Amos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
summons the Philistines and the Egyptians
to behold with amazement and horror the
doings in Samaria. In the oracles with which
the book opens, he pronounces the judgment
of God on the peoples neighbour to Israel,
not solely because they have wronged Israel,
as in so many of the prophecies against the
nations, but because they have violated the
principles of humanity. It is the first assertion
in the Old Testament that there is such a
thing as an international morality. Amos is
the first in the succession of ethical prophets,
the author, so far as we know, of a new idea of
religion. It is deeply significant that he and
Hosea are contemporaries; hardly more than
ten years can lie between Amos's appearance
at Bethel and the earliest of Hosea's prophecies
against the house of Jehu. The God
of Amos is the apotheosis of right, the conscience
of the world that can neither be corrupted
nor sophisticated; the God of Hosea
was born in the heart of a man whose love the
grossest wrong could not quench. Retribution
is the divinity of the one, redemption of
the other.</p>

<p>Amos's conception was the first to take hold;
the earlier prophecies of Isaiah against Judah
are wholly in that mood. Hosea had to wait
a century before his greater thought found a
fruitful soil in Jeremiah and the Deuteronomists.</p>

<p>The predictions of judgment in Amos are
so sweeping and ultimate that later readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
found the message incomplete. Especially
the last oracle (ix. 1 ff.) was an ill-omened
close. Consequently, a messianic pendant
was attached to it (ix. 11-15) by a Judæan
editor, and an imperfect juncture made by
the introduction of vs. 8<small><sup>b</sup></small> (which flatly contradicts
the first half verse) and 9<small><sup>b</sup></small> (no grain shall
fall to the ground) perhaps displacing some
words of the original.</p>

<p>It seems that some imitative pieces have
been inserted also in c. 1; the prophecy against
Judah in ii. 4 f. with its deuteronomic sins,
falls out of the scheme and is generally
recognized as editorial. Slight retouches elsewhere
(e.g. iv. 13; v. 8 f.; ix. 6) need not
detain us. In general the book has suffered
little from the improvers, and the text is in
relatively good preservation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Obadiah.</span>&mdash;The single chapter of Obadiah,
the shortest of the Old Testament books, is a
prophecy against the Edomites, toward whom,
as we have repeatedly seen, the Jews cherished
an implacable animosity from the time of the
fall of Jerusalem. Obadiah vss. 1-9 has
close parallels in Jer. xlix. 7-22 (cf. Obad.
vss. 1-4 with Jer. xlix. 14-16; Obad. vs.
5 f., Jer. xlix. 9 f.; Obad. vs. 8, Jer. xlix. 7).
The question which is the borrower has been
differently answered. Obadiah vss. 15-21,
in which Edom gets its judgment in the Day
of the Lord on the nations, is probably later
than vss. 1-14, but the whole is post-exilic.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span><span class="smcap">Jonah.</span>&mdash;The Book of Jonah has already
been discussed along with the stories of
Esther and Ruth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Micah.</span>&mdash;The prediction of Micah, the
Morashtite, that Zion should be plowed as a
field and Jerusalem be a heap of ruins and the
temple hill become like forest shrines (Mic.
iii. 2), is quoted under his name in Jer. xxvi.
18&mdash;the only example of such a prophetic
quotation in the Old Testament. The author,
a resident of Moresheth-Gath in the Judæan
Lowland, is said in the title to have prophesied
in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
which is the editor's way of saying that he
was a younger contemporary of Isaiah. The
reign of Hezekiah is attested by the tradition
in Jeremiah. It is probable that only cc.
1-3 (with perhaps some dubious possibilities
in the following chapters) can be attributed
to Micah.</p>

<p>The book opens with an oracle against
Samaria (Mic. i. 2-8). Samaria fell in 721
<small>B.C.</small>, while the sequel (vs. 9 ff.) portrays the
imminent peril of Judah, presumably in the
time of Sennacherib (701 <small>B.C.</small>). The case
seems to be similar to Isa. xxviii. 1 ff.: the
fate of Samaria, though it is already fact, is
represented prophetically for a closer parallel
to the following. Verses 10-16 are little more
than a string of ominous puns on the names
of towns in the author's Lowland, which in
translation lose what little point they have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The second chapter gives the cause of the
woe much as in Amos or Isaiah, but perhaps
with local emphasis on the wrongs the capitalists
of the great city inflict on the peasant
proprietors. His forebodings and censures
are not well received, men bid him stop his
preaching, it is a different sort of prophet
they like (ii. 6-11). "If a man, walking in
wind and falsehood, should lie, 'I will preach
to thee of wine and drink,' he will be the
preacher for this people." Micah has more
to say, but not better, about the demagogue
prophets in the following oracle (iii. 5-7).
The predictions of disaster in ii. 1-11 have
their point blunted in vs. 12 f. in the way the
editors of the prophetic books so often do it.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 returns to condemnation, which
turns at last on the heads of the rulers "who
build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with
iniquity," and ends with the prediction of the
total destruction of the city which has already
been quoted.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected follows, in the prophecy
that Jerusalem shall become the religious
centre of the earth, to which all nations flow,
and the law of God the universal arbiter in an
age of universal peace (Mic. iv. 1-5). Verses
1-3 are found also, in no more suitable context,
in Isa. ii. 2-4. They belong to neither
Isaiah nor Micah. For the rest, Mic. 4-5
and cc. 6-7 contain a number of pieces of
diverse age and origin. Chapters iv. 6-v. 1
are as a whole of good omen, yet after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
promise of restoration in iv. 8, Jerusalem
is suddenly in desperate straits; exile awaits
its people, and only beyond the exile (the
words "thou shalt come even unto Babylon"
may be a gloss, but the meaning is not essentially
changed) redemption waits (iv. 9 f.).
In iv. 11-13, again, many nations gather
against Zion, but it crushes them like sheaves
on the threshing floor. There follows (v.
2-9, 10-15) a messianic prophecy, in which
an allusion to Isa. vii. 14 appears.</p>

<p>No less strangely assorted are the oracles in
Mic. 6-7, of which there are four: vi. 1-8; vi.
9-16; vii. 1-6; vii. 7-20. The first of these
contains the quintessence of the prophetic
conception of religion: God does not demand
holocausts and costly offerings in expiation of
sin; nor the supreme expiation which the
prophets and the laws of the seventh century so
often reject and condemn: "Shall I give my
first-born for my transgression, the fruit of
my body for the sin of my soul? He hath
showed thee, O man. What is good and
what doth God require of thee, but to do
justice and love mercy and walk humbly with
thy God?"</p>

<p>Trenchant condemnations of the sins of the
times fill vi. 9-16 and vii. 1-6, the former of
which, at least, is pre-exilic; while the book
closes in the situation and spirit of Isa. 40 ff.
Thus the Book of Micah, like that of his contemporary
Isaiah, has been a depository
for prophecies differing in age by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
centuries. Perhaps the book once stood at
the end of a roll, and was therefore the natural
place to add stray and nameless pieces, as
happened later to the Book of Zechariah
at the end of the volume of the Minor
Prophets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nahum.</span>&mdash;In the three larger prophetic
books we have found groups of oracles against
foreign nations, some relatively old, many
late and literary variations on given motives&mdash;it
was evidently a grateful theme. In
Nahum we have a whole book occupied with
the impending fall of Nineveh and the Assyrian
empire, which had so long and so brutally
tyrannized over all western Asia. Now its
hour has struck, and the prophet triumphs
over the fate of the old lion, who "rent in
pieces to satisfy his whelps and strangled for
his lionesses, and filled his dens with prey
and his lairs with ravin." His imagination
revels in the terrors of the onslaught, the
horrors of the sack, which he depicts with
unsurpassed vividness and great poetic power.
It is the judgment of the Lord, long deferred,
but sure and final (Nah. 1).</p>

<p>In Nah. iii. 8-10 the fate of the Egyptian
Thebes is adduced as an historic example:
all her power could not save her, and it shall
fare no better with Nineveh. The reference
is probably to the capture of Thebes by Assurbanipal
in 661 <small>B.C.</small> Nineveh itself fell about
606 <small>B.C.</small> under an attack of enemies from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
north (Medes or Scythians), and was destroyed
never to be restored. With it the Assyrians
disappear from history. The prophecy of
Nahum was probably delivered shortly before
this event, though a date twenty years earlier,
when, according to Herodotus, Nineveh barely
escaped from a similar onset by Cyaxares, is
not strictly impossible.</p>

<p>It is thought by many scholars that the
first chapter (with which ii. 2 must go) is a
later composition, a poem, much deranged,
originally in acrostic form.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Habakkuk.</span>&mdash;The Book of Habakkuk predicts
that Jehovah is about to raise up the
fierce Chaldæan nation, which marches through
the breadth of the earth to occupy habitations
not belonging to it, which scoffs at kings and
has dynasts in derision, laughing at all fortresses,
against which it casts up a mound and
takes them (Hab. i. 5-11). Such a prophecy
would be timely in the last years of the seventh
century: the Chaldæan, or New Babylonian,
kingdom dates its independence from 625,
and is hardly likely to have attracted much
attention in the West before the fall of Nineveh
in 606 <small>B.C.</small> and the defeat of Pharaoh Necho
on the Euphrates in 605 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The prophecy, which does not specifically
threaten Judah, intrudes between i. 4 and
i. 12 ff., where the plaint of vss. 2-4 is continued,
so that vss. 5-11 are at least misplaced.
This complaint is of the oppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of "the righteous" (Judah) by "the wicked"
(heathen, i. 13-17). From his watch tower
the prophet sees a vision of a distant time,
which he is bidden record, and of whose
ultimate fulfilment he is assured (ii. 1-3).
What follows is a series of invectives which
the nations he has gathered under his robber
rule shall heap upon the fallen oppressor,
"the man who was greedy as hell, insatiable
as death."</p>

<p>The date of the prophecy depends on the
identification of this tyrant of the nations.
If it is Babylon, the oracle must be considered
later than i. 5-11, which greets the rise of the
Babylonian power to execute God's judgment
on the world. An ingenious solution of the
difficulty has been proposed, viz., to transfer
i. 5-11 from c. 1 to a place after ii. 4, and see
in it the contents of the vision spoken of in
ii. 3: the Babylonians would then be the
ministers of God's avenging justice on the
Assyrian robbers of the world, and the whole
might have been uttered about 615 B.C.
All parts of these chapters abound in reminiscences
of the eighth-century prophets; the
resemblances to Jeremiah may be explained
by the contemporaneousness of the authors.</p>

<p>Habakkuk 3, entitled "A Prayer by
Habakkuk the Prophet," with a musical
direction following, as in the Psalms, is in fact
a psalm, and the presence of the musical
directions, implying liturgical use, suggests
that it once stood in a hymn book like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Psalter. It is a fine ode, by an author well
read in the classic literature of his nation.
The theophany (iii. 2 ff.) is indebted to Exod.
xxxiii. 2 ff. and Judg. v. 4 ff. The ode belongs
with the Psalms of the Persian period. It is
imitated in Ps. 77. The title ascribing it to
Habakkuk the prophet is of no greater
authority than the ascription Pss. 146-148
in the Greek Bible to Haggai and Zechariah.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Zephaniah.</span>&mdash;The pedigree of Zephaniah
is carried back to his great-great-grandfather,
Hezekiah. As such genealogical proper names
have seldom more than three terms, it has
been conjectured that the particular reason
for adducing two extra generations here was
that the prophet boasted royal blood&mdash;Hezekiah
was the king of that name. The
thing is possible, though the generations are
somewhat rapid; the parallel royal line
counts four. It would be a romantic touch
if the prophet was a great-grand-nephew of
Manasseh, and a second cousin of Josiah, of
the manners and morals of whose courts he
has so bad an opinion.</p>

<p>The title says that he prophesied in the
reign of Josiah, and with this the tenor of a
large part of the book agrees. Like the earliest
prophecies of Jeremiah (Jer. 1-6) Zephaniah's
Day of the Lord is inspired by the irruption
of the Scythian hordes which threatened to
engulf the civilized nations of western Asia
in a common ruin, as the Mongol and Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hordes, pouring out of the same cradle of the
commissioned races, the scourges of God, did
successively in later ages. For Judah it is
the day of reckoning for the sins which made
the reign of Manasseh a by-word with prophets
and historians, and which went on unrestrained
through the short years of his successor and
the minority of Josiah down to the reforms
of his eighteenth year. Nowhere is the state
of things in that three quarters of a century
more clearly exposed than in the first oracle
of Zephaniah.</p>

<p>The second chapter holds out the possibility
that repentance may still save Judah; the
wave of invasion has taken, as we know from
historical sources it did, the way by the coast,
bringing calamity on the Philistine cities.
It surged on to the very frontier of Egypt,
where it was stayed, more likely by the payment
of a great indemnity than by force of
arms, and rolled back whence it came.
Zephaniah sees the storm break over Assyria,
and predicts the total destruction of the proud
city of Nineveh which had so long said in
her heart, "I, and none beside me." Several
verses in this chapter are suspected of being
later amplifications, viz. ii. 7<small><sup>a</sup></small> (Judah profits
by the ruin of the Philistine plain; vs. 7<small><sup>b</sup></small>
connects directly with vs. 6), and especially
the oracles against Moab and Ammon, which
accuse them of their enmity to Judah in the
time of Nebuchadnezzar, a generation after
Zephaniah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>The first oracle in Zeph. 3 is incomplete;
the original conclusion, a sentence of doom
upon Judah, the only imaginable sequel to
vss. 1-7, is supplanted by the inconsequent
pouring out of God's fury on the nations,
whereupon the heathen are converted, the
dispersion returns, and, purified and chastened
the remnant of Judah enjoys a modest golden
age (iii. 8-13). The book closes in a more
jubilant salutation of the good time coming
(iii. 14-20).</p>

<p>Thus in Zephaniah, as in so many other
prophetic books, all turns out well in the
end; but as in most of the others, the happy
endings are an afterthought of later generations
for whom the judgment was in the past
but the golden age had not yet come.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Haggai.</span>&mdash;Haggai dates his first revelation
to the very day of the month&mdash;a new
fashion which he and his contemporary
Zechariah have&mdash;the first day of the sixth
month (of the Jewish calendar) in the second
year of Darius (Hystaspis), that is, 520 <small>B.C.</small>
He has the word of the Lord for Zerubbabel,
the governor of Judah, and Joshua, the chief
priest, that it is high time to rebuild the
temple; the lean years they have been
having are due to God's displeasure that
he is thus neglected. The civil and religious
heads of the community stir up the people
and the work begins; again the exact date
is given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Three other oracles follow, all in the same
year. The first of these (ii. 1-9) encourages
Zerubbabel and the people to more zeal by
the prediction that the great crisis of history
is at hand: yet a little while and the Lord
will shake the heavens and the earth; he
will shake all the nations, and the treasures
of all the nations shall flow to his temple (cf.
Isa. lx. 9 ff.), and God will fill the house with
his glory. The third (ii. 20-23), to Zerubbabel,
foretells the overthrow and destruction
of the kingdoms of the nations; and, in prudently
veiled phrase&mdash;since such great expectations
might have ill consequences if they
reached Persian ears&mdash;the restoration of
Zerubbabel to the throne of his fathers, fulfilling
the messianic predictions of earlier
prophets. The intervening oracle (ii. 10-19)
is another spur to zeal in rebuilding the
temple.</p>

<p>The immediate restoration of Jewish nationality
which Haggai and Zechariah so confidently
foretold was not merely the expression
of a general faith or the result of studies
in their predecessors. For in reality God was
shaking the nations; in particular the Persian
empire, newly made master of the world, was
shaken to its foundations by the usurpation
of the pretended Smerdis, the death of
Cambyses, the conspiracy of the nobles
against Smerdis, and the elevation of Darius
to the throne. In the years when the Jewish
prophets were making their predictions, Darius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was confronted by formidable rebellions in
every quarter of the empire except the west.
It might well appear to Haggai that the
armies of the nations were falling every one
by the sword of his fellow.</p>

<p>In the end Darius put down all opposition
and welded the empire together more strongly
than ever; the brief dream of Jewish independence
under a Davidic prince and the
brighter vision of the golden age faded.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Zechariah.</span>&mdash;Zechariah's first oracle is dated
in the month after that in which Haggai's
first was delivered. It is a brief exhortation
to his countrymen to repent, and not neglect
the warnings of the prophets as their
fathers had done, to their sorrow when the
predicted judgments overtook them (Zech.
i. 1-6). Then follow, in i. 7-vi. 15, under
the common date (second year of Darius,
11th month, 24th day), a series of eight visions,
the meaning of which is interpreted to the
prophet by an angel. They symbolize the
shattering of the power of the nations; the
rebuilding of the temple and city, and the
golden age to follow; the removal of the
sin of Judah; the recognition of the Messiah
(Zerubbabel); the harmony of prince and
priest.</p>

<p>At the end of this group of visions is a bit
of history of high interest. A crown was made
of gold and silver brought by some representatives
of the Babylonian Jews, and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the prophet on the head of Zerubbabel,
who was saluted as "the Scion," i.e., the
Messiah (Jer. xxiii. 5), with the prediction
that he should rebuild the temple, assume
majesty, and sit and rule upon his throne.
The coronation, it need hardly be said, was in
the secrecy of a private house, and is to be
regarded as a symbolical act; the Babylonian
envoys kept the crown as a memento. But
its significance is unmistakable.</p>

<p>The prediction was not fulfilled. Whatever
became of Zerubbabel&mdash;he disappears
with this scene&mdash;he never wore a real crown
nor sat upon the throne of his fathers. This
has led to more than one change in the text,
which, however, as in many other cases, were
not sufficiently thorough-going to pass unnoticed.
First, the crown is once made plural,
"crowns," as though the intention was to
crown both the prince and the priest; when it
comes to the coronation, however, only Joshua,
the high priest, receives the honour (vi. 11).
But vss. 12, 13<small><sup>a</sup></small>, which are left untouched,
can refer only to Zerubbabel. Verse 13<small><sup>b</sup></small> originally
read, "and [Joshua] shall be priest <i>at
his right hand</i> (so the Greek Bible, instead of
"on his throne"), and there shall be harmony
between the two." In vs. 14 there is only
one crown.</p>

<p>In Zech. 7 the question is asked of the
prophet by some pilgrims from Bethel, whether,
now that the temple was rebuilding, they
should continue to keep the fast for the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the temple in the fifth month; his
response, that what God wants of them is not
fasting but justice, charity, compassion, that
none should oppress his neighbour nor devise
evil against him, is quite in the spirit of the
earlier prophets to whom he appeals.</p>

<p>He goes on, in c. 8, to picture the coming
golden age, when the fasts shall all be turned
into cheerful feasts, a prophecy which is one
of the finest of its kind in the Old Testament
and a fitting crown to the book.</p>

<p>The prophecies of Zechariah (cc. 1-8)
are definitely dated; they spring out of a
definite historical and religious situation
which is everywhere apparent and consistent.
Not so the chapters which follow (cc. 9-14).
The titles (ix. 1; xii. 1) have a different
form ("Burdens"), the situations which give
their background to the oracles are wholly
unlike that which stands out so clearly in
Haggai and Zechariah; the character of the
prophecies, with their affected obscurity,
easily penetrable, doubtless, to contemporaries,
but impenetrable to us who have not
the historical key, and their apocalyptic
eschatology, are in strong contrast to the
manner of Zechariah; the evidence of diction
confirms that of situation and content.</p>

<p>It has, therefore, long been recognized that
none of these prophecies can be by the author
of Zech. 1-8: they are anonymous oracles
which have been appended at the close of his
book or of the Book of the Minor Prophets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
They are not all by the same author: cc. 12-14
contain two pictures (xiii. 1-xiii. 6; xiv.
1-21) of the final onset of the heathen on
Jerusalem, their destruction, and the golden
age of pious prosperity that ensues, variations
of Ezekiel's original in the great prophecy
of Gog (Ezek. 38-39) which gave the scheme
for all subsequent revelations on the last times.
A notable difference between the two pictures
is that in Zech. 12 the heathen are destroyed
by the clans of Judah, who deliver Jerusalem;
while in c. 14 Jerusalem is taken by
the heathen and subjected to all the horrors
of a sack, half of its inhabitants being carried
into slavery, before Jehovah himself, descending
on the Mount of Olives, fights against the
nations and cleaves the mount itself in twain.</p>

<p>In cc. xii. 1-xiii. 6 concrete features of the
author's time are probably discernible, in
the fact, for instance, that Judah (that is
the inhabitants of the other towns and the
country) besieges Jerusalem in company with
the neighbouring heathen peoples, and in the
striking animosity displayed toward the prophets,
who are in the same condemnation
with the idols and arouse much intenser feeling
(xii. 2-6). Our ignorance of the internal
history of the Jewish community for two or
three centuries is, however, so complete that
these allusions furnish us no clue.</p>

<p>In Zech. 9-11 also there are two sections,
viz. ix. 1-xi. 3 and xi. 4-17 + xiii. 7-9. The age
of these can be fixed with greater confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by the external historical situation. The
heathen power the overthrow of which ushers
in the golden age is named, in ix. 13, the
Greeks. Egypt and Syria ("Assyria"), that
is, the kingdoms of the Ptolemies and the
Seleucids, shall be brought low (x. 11). "The
land of Hadrach," to which the first oracle is
directed, is in all probability the region of
Antioch, the Seleucid capital. The bad
"shepherds" of cc. 11; xiii. 7-9, who are
over the flock of God, are very good
likenesses of the Jewish high priests of the
Greek time, though it is impossible to identify
the concrete historical persons and events
of c. 11. Taking all together, we shall not go
amiss in ascribing these to the early part of
the third century <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;say between the year
200, when Judæa came under Seleucid rule
and the religious persecution of Antiochus
Epiphanes and the Maccabæan revolt, to
neither of which is there any allusion in the
chapters. Chapters 12-14 may perhaps be
put in the century before.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Malachi.</span>&mdash;A third appendix to the Book of
Zechariah is the anonymous book which we
call Malachi. The earliest title, "The Burden
of the Word of the Lord against Israel,"
is word for word the same as that in Zech.
xii. 1 (cf. ix. 1), and doubtless was prefixed
by the same editor. Subsequently, perhaps
to give the book an independent status and
thus round out the number of the Minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Prophets to twelve, the words "by 'My
Messenger'" (Heb. <i>malaki</i>; iii. 1 f.) were
added. Jewish tradition in later times identified
this messenger with Ezra. In the versions
the word was naturally taken for a proper
name.</p>

<p>The book consists of two parts, Mal. i. 2-ii.
9, which from i. 6 on is addressed to the priests,
and ii. 10-iv. 3, to the people at large. The
priests treat the worship in the temple with
professional disrespect, under which lurks
an equally professional scepticism. Any kind
of blemished or diseased victim is good enough&mdash;the
prophet invites them to make such a
scurvy gift to the governor! The perpetual
routine of sacred services they find tiresome.
They are no less negligent in their other
great function as the religious teachers and
guides of the people. The <i>Tora</i>, that is, the
revealed will of God, is committed to them,
and they, degenerate successors of the faithful
priests in the good old times, have not only
themselves abandoned the right way, but
have caused many to fall by their false
instructions. They have earned the contempt
in which men hold them. The curse of God
is on them.</p>

<p>One of the most notable words in the
Bible stands in this indignant denunciation
(Mal. i. 11 f.). Jehovah's own priests in
his own temple treat his worship with contempt;
he refuses their offerings: "For
from the rising of the sun to the setting, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
name is great among the nations, and in
every place pure sacrifices are burnt to my
name among the nations, saith Jehovah
of Hosts; but <i>ye</i> profane it by thinking
that the table of Jehovah may be polluted
and his food despised." That the sacrifices
of the heathen may be "pure" sacrifices,
though not according to the Mosaic rite,
because all true worship is the worship of the
true God, is a conception quite unparalleled in
the Old Testament. The author's polemic
against the priests of Jerusalem has doubtless
made him say more than he would have stood
by as a dogmatic statement; more, indeed,
than any church has ever been ready to
acknowledge, but it was fitting that it should
be said, for it is the final consequence of the
ethical conception of religion of which the
Hebrew prophets from Amos on are the
exponents.</p>

<p>Of the remaining oracles, one (Mal. iii. 6-12)
urges to the honest consecration of the tithes
(dues to the temple); another (ii. 10-16), as
commonly interpreted, condemns the marriages
with heathen women which so disturbed
the soul of Nehemiah and Ezra,
and especially the divorce of native wives
to take foreign ones; but the language
should perhaps rather be taken as figurative
for foreign worship. The two remaining
prophecies (ii. 17-iii. 5; iii. 13-iv. 3) are
addressed to such as thought that God did not
trouble himself about men's affairs: the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
threatened day of doom gave no sign of
coming, nor was the promised reward of serving
God bestowed. The prophet declares
that the Day will come, sudden and terrible,
and the ungodly will get their deserts. The
last verses (iv. 4-6) are not improbably an
addition by an editorial hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>PSALMS. LAMENTATIONS</h3>


<p>The Book of Psalms counts one hundred and
fifty hymns, and this evidently by design, for
the Greek Version, which sometimes unites
in one what are two psalms in the Hebrew
and divides one Hebrew psalm into two, comes
out with the same number. It is divided into
five books, as is indicated in the Revised
English Version, vis. Book I., Pss. 1-41;
Book II., Pss. 42-72; Book III., Pss. 73-89;
Book IV., Pss. 90-106; Book V., Pss. 107-150,
each book ending with a liturgical
doxology. The rabbis were probably right
in the opinion that this fivefold division
was made in imitation of the five books
of the Pentateuch, but in some cases, as we
shall see, the limits correspond to those of
older separate books. The psalter has not
inaptly been called the hymn book of the
second temple. We learn from Jewish tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that certain psalms were used in the
liturgy of the Herodian temple on certain
days or at certain seasons, and to many
of them musical or liturgical directions are
prefixed and interludes are noted ("Selah"),
from which, apart from tradition, such a use
would be inferred. It is evident from the
familiarity with the Psalms which is shown
in the New Testament and in contemporary
Jewish writings, both Greek and Hebrew, that,
like our hymn books, the Psalter was largely
used for private devotion and edification.</p>

<p>The poems contained in the Psalter are
from different ages and authors, and of widely
diverse religious worth and poetical excellence.
Some of them are unsurpassed in the religious
literature of the world; others are the tedious
production of authors who, like so many hymnists
of all climes, were neither born nor made
poets. Thanks to the translators, such pieces
are a great deal better, so far as expression
goes, in the Authorized English Version or in
Luther's, than the original.</p>

<p>A modern hymn book is seldom, if ever, a
fresh compilation from the sources; it is habitually
made up from collections already in use,
with the addition, perhaps, of the editor's
gleanings from the sources, or of recent poems.
The names of the collections thus used may
be given, and the names of the authors&mdash;often
taken along without verification. Editors of
hymn books have also generally allowed
themselves great liberties with the text of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
hymns, altering them to suit their own taste
or the religious and theological idiosyncrasies
of their sect; abridging, transposing, expanding,
without scruple; and only in very modern
times has a tardily awakened literary conscience
constrained them to give notice of such
changes. In this way mediæval Catholic poets
are made to sing good Protestant songs, or
Calvinists and Methodists to drop their shibboleths
and express themselves in a manner
acceptable to Unitarians. The familiar hymn,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"O for a thousand tongues to sing my dear Redeemer's praise,"</span>
</div>

<p>has been adapted to Buddhist use as,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"O for a thousand tongues to sing my holy Buddha's praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glories of my teacher great, the triumphs of his grace,"</span>
</div>

<p>with similar changes throughout, and if we
did not know the Christian hymn, we might
take the author for a good Shin-shu Buddhist,
though an indifferent poet.</p>

<p>The editors of the Psalter proceeded in the
same way, and the older recollections on which
they worked can in part be recognized. It is
observed that Books II. and III. of the
Psalter (Pss. 42-89), or, more exactly, Pss.
42-83, must once have formed a collection by
themselves, whose editor was averse to the
use of the proper name Jehovah, and accordingly
altered the text of the hymns where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
this name occurred by substituting the appellative
God (Elohim), giving rise to such strange
expressions as "O God, my God." Thus
Ps. 53 is the same with Ps. 14, but wherever
Jehovah stands in Ps. 14, "God" takes its
place in Ps. 53; Ps. 70 is merely an extract
from Ps. 40 (vss. 13-17) with the same change.
In the latter, however, copyists, influenced
by the parallel passage, have restored "Jehovah"
in one (Greek) or two (Hebrew) places,
as they have done in other of these psalms.
This occurrence of the same hymn in two
parts of the Psalter, of which another instance
is Ps. 108 (made up of parts of two psalms in
the elohistic book, lvii. 7-11, and lx. 5-12), is
itself presumptive evidence that these parts
once existed separately. At the time when
the musical directions were prefixed to the
psalms, the last two books (Pss. 90-150) seem
not to have been included in the temple hymn
book; for these directions, scattered through
Pss. 1-89, are lacking from that point on,
notwithstanding the fact that a larger proportion
of the psalms in Pss. 90-150 were manifestly
composed for public worship than in
Pss. 1-89.</p>

<p>The titles of Psalms give the names of other
collections from which individual psalms were
taken. Thus twelve psalms, Pss. 42, 44-49,
84, 85, 87, 88, are hymns or songs of the
Korahites, and eleven, Pss. 50, 73-83, of Asaph,
who were according to the Chronicler&mdash;a good
authority on the worship of his time&mdash;families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
or hereditary guilds, of temple musicians, and
seem, in this capacity, to have had special
hymn books containing psalms which they
sang, and which may also have been composed
by members of the guild. The fact
that the Korahite and Asaphite psalms are
not scattered through the present Psalter,
but appear in groups, and only in the elohistic
hymn book (Pss. 42-89), confirms this view.
When they were incorporated in the collection,
the source was indicated by prefixing the name
of the guild book to the individual psalms.</p>

<p>Another group of fifteen psalms (Pss. 120-134)
bear in their titles, "The Song of the
Ascents," a phrase which, by the irregularity
of its form, shows that it was transferred
mechanically from the title of the collection
("The Songs of the Ascents") to the individual
poems. The ancient interpretation makes the
"ascents" the fifteen steps, or ascending
platforms, on which the levitical orchestra
stood at the festival of the water-drawing on
the evening after the first day of Tabernacles
(hence the Authorized Version, Song of Degrees,
i.e. Steps). We need not discuss the
question; that these psalms constitute a
liturgical unit selected for a specific ceremony
is plain.</p>

<p>A considerable number of psalms have
loosely prefixed to them the words Hallelu
Jah (Praise ye Jah), which in the Hebrew text
are frequently found at the end, having been
erroneously carried back from the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of a following psalm. When this displacement
(which is later than the Greek translation)
is corrected, the Hallelujah psalms are 105-107,
111-118, 135, 136, 146-150. Here also
a liturgical collection is naturally inferred.
Jewish tradition informs us about the use of
the "Hallel" (Pss. 113-118) and the "Great
Hallel" (Ps. 136) at the festivals, and the
name Hallel is also sometimes given to Pss.
146-148. Both the Hallels and the Songs of
Degrees, it will be observed, are in the
last of the three parts of the Psalter (Pss.
90-150).</p>

<p>Of greater interest is the large collection of
psalms which bear individually the name of
David. This name is found in the titles of
all the psalms in Book I. (Pss. 1-41), except
Pss. 1 and 2, 10 (properly a part of 9, as in
the Greek Bible), and 33 (in the Greek
Bible Davidic); further, in Book II., two
groups, Pss. 51-65, 68-70, and thereafter,
scattering, Pss. 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122,
124, 131, 133, 138-145&mdash;73 psalms in all, or
almost half the Psalter. Manuscripts of the
Greek Bible add a varying number of others,
and other versions do the same.</p>

<p>In the light of the phenomena we have
already observed, we may confidently infer
that there was once a collection of religious
lyrics bearing some such title as "Hymns of
David." So long as this book had a separate
existence, the name would naturally not be
repeated at the head of the individual poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in it; such repetition became necessary, however,
when psalms from this book were taken
up into a larger hymn book containing not
only psalms from the Korahite and Asaphite
collections but many anonymous hymns;
just as the name of Charles Wesley would be
attached to one of his hymns only when it
was taken out of his own volume and included
in a composite hymn book. By good fortune
we have the colophon of this Davidic Psalter
in Ps. lxxii. 20, in the words of a scribe:
"The Prayers (an older name for Psalms) of
David son of Jesse are finished," that is, the
roll containing them is copied to the end&mdash;a
very common Oriental form of colophon.
Curiously enough, the hymn to which this
note is annexed is said in its title to be by
Solomon, to whom Ps. 127 (one of the Songs
of Degrees) is similarly attributed. In both
cases the ground of the ascription is plain:
the editor thought that Ps. cxxvii. 1 referred
to the building of the temple, while the prayer
for wisdom with which Ps. 72 begins suggested
to him Solomon's dream, 1 Kings 3.</p>

<p>From this Davidic hymn book came what is
now the first book of the Psalter entire, except
Ps. 1 and probably 2; further the groups in
Book II. (51-65, 68-70, with 72), which probably
stood immediately after Ps. 41. For it
will be noted that the second (elohistic) part
of the present Psalter (Pss. 42-89) is made up
of Korahite, Asaphite, and Davidic psalms,
and that in their present position the Davidic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
psalms, say Pss. 51-72, are thrust into the
otherwise solid group of Asaphite hymns
Pss. 50 ... 73-83. Further, the transposition
of the Davidic psalms to the beginning
of the book would bring the hymns of the
guilds together. The elohistic recension does
not extend consistently beyond Ps. 83; and
Pss. 84-89 (Korahite) may therefore be
regarded as a supplementary extract from
the guild book.</p>

<p>The titles of several of the Davidic psalms
specify the occasion and circumstances in
which the poem was composed; these historical
notes are especially numerous in the
group Pss. 51-72 (see Pss. 51, 52, 54, 56, 57,
59, 60, 63), but occur also in the First Book
(Pss. 3, 7, 18, 34), and in Ps. 142 (cf. Ps. 57).
The incidents referred to are, with one
exception, all narrated in the Books of Samuel.
There is no reason to imagine that the editor
had any tradition about the origin of these
particular poems, much less authentic information
on the subject. Precisely as in the
ascription of Pss. 72 and 127 to Solomon, he
combined what he took to be allusions to a
historical situation in the poems with the
history as he read it. Psalm 51, for example,
is a confession of deep sinfulness, and seems to
specify blood-guilt (vs. 14). When had David
reason to express himself in this manner?
Clearly after his adultery with Bathsheba
and the murder of Uriah. It is a very
familiar procedure. Modern commentators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
have made many similar guesses, but nobody
attaches any authority to them.</p>

<p>Whether the scattered Davidic psalms in the
last part of the Psalter (Pss. 90-150) are a
gleaning from the Davidic hymn book of
poems which had not been included by previous
editors or come from some other source
is uncertain; the latter is the more probable
hypothesis.</p>

<p>The Psalter, in the form in which we have
it, is one of the latest books in the Old Testament,
for it contains poems in which the religious
persecution of Antiochus IV. and the
Maccabæan struggle are clearly reflected, and
very likely events still further down in the
second century <small>B.C.</small> This was shown by an
acute critic at the beginning of the fifth
century <small>A.D.</small>, and in the Reformation century
John Calvin rightly referred Pss. 44 and 74
to the Maccabæan times, and admitted the
same possibility for Ps. 79. All these are
from the Korahite and Asaphite collections
included in the elohistic hymn book, which
itself is not the youngest of the sources of our
Psalter.</p>

<p>Numerous other psalms are, with greater or
less probability, assigned to the same age;
thus, Ps. 149, where the saints, with the high
praises of God in their mouths and a two-edged
sword in their hands, execute judgment
on the heathen, is singularly apt to the
Maccabæan victories. Psalm 110 ("Davidic")
most naturally is understood as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Asmonæan princes, since in them alone
priesthood and royalty were united.</p>

<p>There are, however, other and more conclusive
criteria than references to historical events
or persons. The religious situation in the
Jewish community reflected in very many of
the psalms is that of the Persian and Greek
period, not that of the days of the kingdom.
The strife of parties or of classes, on one side
the righteous, the pious, the poor, for whom
the psalmists speak, on the other, the wicked,
the ungodly, the rich and the great; here
those whose delight is in the law of God
(religion), there those who contemn it and
pursue evil ways regardless of its precepts
and prohibitions, is a new condition, not in
the behaviour of the wicked, but in the self-consciousness
of the pious, who feel themselves
a distinct class and are evidently
crystallizing into a party or a sect.</p>

<p>The religious conceptions and the conception
of religion are drawn chiefly from Jeremiah
and the Deuteronomists, and from Isaiah
40 ff., but on the subjective side of religion,
piety, the best of the psalms represent a more
advanced stage than the prophets of the
seventh and sixth centuries. The hopes of the
future of God's people and of the world run
with the prophets of the Persian period and the
contemporary anonymous and editorial additions
to the older prophetic books. That
the long rehearsals of the ancient history
like Pss. 78, 105, 106, or eulogies of the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
such as Ps. 119, or litanies of the fashion of Ps.
136, belong to a stage in the history of the
liturgy such as rouses the enthusiasm of the
Chronicler is also apparent. The evidence of
language tends the same way. Fine hymns
were written even at a late time; but on a
large part of the psalms the decadence has
set its mark.</p>

<p>Such is the impression the Psalter makes as
a whole, and it indicates that not only is the
existing collection late, but that most of the
hymns in it were comparatively modern when
they were brought together. This is what
would be expected in a hymn book, which
for devotional even more than for liturgical
use, needs to express and nurture the type of
piety prevalent in its own time and circle.
Protestant hymn books fifty years ago, outside
the Anglican communion, had hardly any
hymns in them more than a couple of hundred
years old, except versified translations of the
psalms, modernized and Christianized in the
operation.</p>

<p>It would be going much beyond the evidence
to say there were no psalms in the Psalter
that were composed in the days of the kingdom;
there may be a considerable number.
But the proof that any particular psalm came
from that period is difficult and seldom very
convincing. This is true even of the psalms
which speak of the king; for, aside from the
impossibility of deciding in some instances
whether a reigning king is meant or the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the good time coming (Messiah), a foreign
king may sometimes be in mind (Ps. 45 is so
interpreted by many), or an Asmonæan king.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lamentations.</span>&mdash;The fall of Jerusalem in
586 <small>B.C.</small> is the subject of five poems of considerable
length which together make the Book
of Lamentations. The mistaken opinion that
the prophet Jeremiah was the author caused
this book to be put immediately after Jeremiah
in the Christian Bible, with an introduction
explicitly attributing the poems, or
the first of them, to the prophet. In the
Hebrew Bible the book stands among the
miscellaneous Scriptures. The first four poems
are in the Hebrew elegiac metre, the verse
used for dirges, the characteristic of which is
that each line is divided by a cæsura into
unequal parts, oftenest in the ratio of three to
two, as in Amos v. 1.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Fállen no móre to ríse | is Ísrael's dáughter!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Próstrate to éarth she líes, | nó one to líft her.</span>
</div>

<p>In Lamentations 1-4 this is combined with an
alphabetic acrostic. In cc. 1 and 2 the poem
consists of twenty-two tiercets, the first line
of each beginning with a letter of the alphabet
in order; c. 4, of as many couplets; while
in c. 3 each line of the tiercet begins with the
proper letter. Chapter 5 is neither alphabetic
nor in elegiac metre. The alphabetic artifice
is not uncommon with Hebrew poets, the most
elaborate example being Ps. 119, where in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
stanzas of seven verses each line of the stanza
begins with A, B, G, D, and so on.</p>

<p>The five Lamentations differ considerably
in character and poetic merit. Chapters 2
and 4 are distinctly superior to the rest, and
describe the agony of Jerusalem in vivid and
moving images; peculiarly direct and poignant
is c. 5; while c. 3 has more the character
of a psalm.</p>

<p>The poems are not all by the same author.
Those which seem to stand nearest to the
catastrophe (cc. 2 and 4 at least) were probably
written no very long time after it; the
others perhaps in the following generation.
There is nothing in them that would lead us
to think of Jeremiah as the author. Perhaps
the statement of the Chronicler that Jeremiah
made a dirge for King Josiah which was written
among the Lamentations, and recited in later
times by the professional singers of dirges,
may imply that he ascribed one of the poems
to the prophet. At any rate, it became
"tradition," and has chiefly contributed to
get Jeremiah the injurious reputation of the

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>PROVERBS</h3>


<p>The Book of Proverbs bears the title "The
Proverbs of Solomon son of David, King of
Israel." Other titles scattered through the
book prove that it is made up of several collections
of proverbs which once circulated
independently. Thus Prov. 10 begins, "The
Proverbs of Solomon"; xxii. 17-21 is an
introduction inviting the reader to give
attention to "Sayings of Sages," and dwelling
on the profit of so doing; xxiv. 23, "These
also are by the Sages"; xxv. 1, "These
also are Proverbs of Solomon which the men
of Hezekiah king of Judah edited"; xxx. 1,
"The Sayings of Agur son of Jakeh"; xxxi.
1, "The sayings of Lemuel King of Massa (?),
which his mother taught him"; finally, xxxi.
10-31 is an anonymous alphabetic poem in
praise of the good housewife.</p>

<p>The inference of diverse origin drawn from
these titles is confirmed by diversity of
character and form, and by the repetition of
proverbs in the different sections, especially
in Prov. x. 1-xxii. 16 and cc. 25-29; on the
other hand, the similarity of all parts of the
book in thought and expression indicates
that there is among them no wide difference
in time. The theme of the book is "wisdom,"
by which is meant primarily a practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
wisdom in the conduct of individual life under
the social, political, and economic conditions
of the time. The end is a prosperous and
happy life, and the motive is enlightened self-interest.
Experience shows that morality
conduces to prosperity and happiness, and
immoral and unsocial actions to the opposite.
To inculcate this truth and to apply it is the
aim of the wise, who make this knowledge the
foundation of virtue and of well-being.</p>

<p>Their instruction is not given in the form of
a philosophical ethic, with a discussion of the
nature of the highest good and of the principles
and motives of conduct, but in sententious
maxims, or aphorisms, sometimes grouped
upon a central theme, often without any thread
of connection. Religion is affirmed by the
most reflective of these authors to be the first
principle of wisdom (Prov. i. 7; ix. 10; cf.
xv. 33), but there is no appeal to a divine law
or to the conscience of the individual; the
maxims are based on observation and experience.
The opposite of wisdom is folly;
it is an unintelligent selfishness which ignores
the consequences of its course, and sooner or
later involves itself in loss or ruin. For ruin
is the end of persistent folly as happiness is
the fruit of wisdom. This is the order of the
world; God's ordering, no doubt, but working
itself out by natural law. Wise men and
fools are two permanent classes of men, divided
by as hard a line as in the Stoic ethics is drawn
between the virtuous man and the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
mankind. The authors know no degrees of
wisdom; they recognize different kinds of
folly, but no difference in fools.</p>

<p>The pictures of society they draw are
chiefly of city life, with its temptations and
vices, and they closely resemble those which
Jesus the son of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) paints
about 200 <small>B.C.</small> Monotheism is taken for
granted; among the many follies the sages
condemn, the folly of polytheism and idolatry
does not appear. The national particularism
of the Jewish religion is nowhere in evidence;
the cultus is hardly referred to, except to say
that the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,
or that justice is more acceptable to the
Lord than sacrifice.</p>

<p>These features are doubtless due in part to
the distinctive tendencies of the moralists,
but they also reflect the times. We find them
in Job, in Sirach, and in Ecclesiastes, other
products of Jewish "Wisdom" which date
from the later Persian or Greek period; and
we have every reason to believe that this
peculiar development, of which we have no
trace earlier, was characteristic of that age.
With this the evidence of language accords.</p>

<p>Of the several parts of the book, Prov. x.
1-xxii. 16 seem to be the oldest, and may be
from the Persian period; the following
chapters are later. So also is Prov. 1-9,
which may well have been written under
Ptolemaic rule (say 320-200 <small>B.C.</small>), when the
Jews enjoyed times of peace and prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The latter author treats his topics more
sustainedly, though without logical disposition
or connection, in a warm and friendly tone
such as an experienced elder might use toward
a youth. The style is easy and flowing, and
sometimes rises to poetic inspiration. The
personifications of wisdom and folly in c. 9
give a good example of his manner. A more
philosophical mind is recognized in c. 8, with
its personification of the divine wisdom, first
of God's creations, the skilled artificer who
was by his side at the making of the world,
rejoicing in God's habitable earth and the
sons of men who people it. Here the author
comes near the conceptions of the Greek
"Wisdom of Solomon," and prepares the way
for the theological hypostases of Wisdom and
the divine Reason and Word (Logos).</p>

<p>Even among the aphorisms of the older
collections, there are few that have the stamp
of true popular proverbs, the wisdom of the
generations finding the pregnant phrase in
the mouth of the people; they are, what
indeed they profess to be, maxims of the sages,
fashioned with conscious art for a didactic
end. And these sages seem to have been,
like the Greek sophists, professional teachers
of the youth of the well-to-do classes.</p>

<p>That the bulk of this wisdom, when compilation
of it came to be made, should have
been labelled Solomonic, is explained by
Solomon's fame for wisdom, which is the
subject of numerous anecdotes in the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
books (see 1 Kings iii. 4-15, with the examples,
ibid. vs. 16-28; 1 Kings x. 1-14, etc.), coupled
with the explicit statement that he "spake
three thousand proverbs," not to mention
his songs and his expeditions into natural
history (1 Kings iv. 29-34). In later times
Solomon's fame for wisdom was not that of an
ethical philosopher but of an adept in magic.
It is almost a pity to take away from Solomon
the urgent warnings against women in which
the Proverbs abound; they have in his mouth
such a mordant irony.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>JOB</h3>


<p>The Book of Job is the greatest work of
Hebrew literature that has come down to us,
and one of the great poetical works of the
world's literature. In the form of a colloquy
between Job and his friends, in which at last
God intervenes, it discusses the gravest
problem of theodicy, How can the suffering
of a good man be reconciled with the moral
government of God?</p>

<p>In a prose introduction the reader is
apprised of the true cause of Job's sufferings,
of which the parties to the colloquy are, of
course, ignorant: they are a trial of his uprightness,
more specifically, of his disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
virtue. In this "prologue in heaven," Satan
insists that Job's exemplary virtue is no
wonder, since God rewards him so well for it,
and God, who has full faith in the patriarch,
gives Satan permission to test him. In an
hour all his wealth is swept away and his
children perish, but Job bows submissive to
God's will. Then he himself is smitten with
a loathsome and distressful ailment which
was regarded as in a peculiar sense the stroke
of God, his wife bids him "bless" God (a
euphemism for "curse") and die; but he
rebukes her: "What? shall we receive good
at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
evil? In all this did not Job sin with his
lips." His three friends come to bemoan
him and to comfort him, but the sight of his
misery makes them dumb; they sit down with
him in silence for seven days. So far the
prologue.</p>

<p>On this scene the poem opens: Job's long
suppressed grief breaks out in bitter words; he
curses the day of his birth, he envies the dead
who are at rest. The eldest of the three friends
answers him, and so the colloquy begins.
The structure of the poem is symmetrical.
Each friend speaks in turn and to each Job
replies. The cycle is thrice repeated (cc.
4-14; 15-21; 22-26), but, at least in the
present text, the third round is incomplete&mdash;Zophar
has no speech. The friends being
apparently convinced that it is useless to
argue with him, Job soliloquizes (cc. 27-31),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
contrasting his former prosperity with his
present adversity, and again protesting his
good conscience before God and men.</p>

<p>Now a new disputant comes on the scene,
whose name does not appear among the
dramatis personæ, the youthful Elihu; a
short prose introduction tells us who he is, and
why he intrudes. He is incensed at them
all; at Job for justifying himself at God's
expense, at the friends for not having found
arguments to put him down. For his part,
he is so full of words that he cannot hold in.
He delivers himself, accordingly, of four
speeches (cc. 32 f.; 34; 35; 36), to which
Job vouchsafes no reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly God, whom Job had alternately
challenged and implored to appear, answers
him out of the whirlwind (cc. 38-41); with
Job's confession of his presumption in speaking
of things he understood not (xlii. 1-6), the
poem ends.</p>

<p>In the prose epilogue God condemns the
three friends, whom he pardons at Job's
prayer; and the trial over, God, in poetical
justice, restores Job to a prosperity greater
than the first.</p>

<p>In the argument, the three friends and
Elihu maintain throughout the view of divine
retribution which was plainly the orthodoxy
of the author's time: God rewards piety and
virtue with prosperity and requites sin with
adversity. This law is grounded in the
righteousness of God; it is inconceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that he should act otherwise. Consequently
if a man is overwhelmed by calamity, as Job
is, the only explanation their religion can
allow is that he is a great sinner; any other
interpretation would impugn the justice of
God or bring into question the existence of a
divine providence. They recognize, indeed,
that in sending suffering God may design
through chastisement or by way of warning to
bring the sinner to repentance and amendment;
they admit that suffering may be a
trial of man's faith. They present the matter
to Job thus, especially in their earlier speeches;
but the character of Job's replies convinces
them that neither of these is his case, and
they come at last to outspoken accusation.</p>

<p>Job denies their insinuations and their
charges. He has done nothing to deserve
such a fate; if they insist on calling this God's
justice, he will say straight in God's face that
he is an almighty tyrant, who unjustly
destroys an innocent man. If God slay him
for it, he will not belie his conscious rectitude.</p>

<p>The argument goes round and round, takes
this or that turn, grows hotter as it proceeds,
but does not get beyond this deadlock. The
author's motive so far is clear: he means to
controvert the dogma that all suffering, or at
least extraordinary suffering, is retributive,
and to show in the instance of Job how this
doctrine may drive a godly man to the denial
of God's justice altogether. With remarkable
psychological insight, however, he makes Job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
not only cling to the belief that God is more
just than his dealings with him show, but
makes this faith grow in even steps with his
passionate charges of injustice. He appeals
from the injustice of God to the just God
who some day will have to justify him.</p>

<p>The author meant to refute the doctrine that
God's providence is exhaustively explained
by distributive justice. Had he his own
solution of the problem of theodicy to put in
the place of that cruel dogma? Job, we have
seen, finds no solution. In the speeches of
Jehovah, where dramatic fitness would lead
us to look for the author's solution if he had
one, there is no refutation of Job's charges,
no response to his pleadings. The speeches
are splendid, but the gist of them is that
God's ways are inscrutable. If man cannot
comprehend God's operations in nature, what
folly, what presumption, to pretend to fathom
his dealings in providence! In that Job
acquiesces for the soul of man. Let his
sufferings be a mystery, he can submit and
trust; call them punitive, and he revolts
against the injustice. That is the end to
which the author would bring his readers.
Some one has said that there is nothing about
which men are usually so sure as about the
character of God, and nothing they are so
ready to do as to interpret his dealings by his
character&mdash;especially his dealings with others.
Such were Job's friends. And from this point
of view we have no difficulty in understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
what has stumbled some critics, how they,
with their zeal for God's character&mdash;that is,
for their orthodox conception of it&mdash;come off
in the epilogue with so smart a rebuke, while
Job, whose words seemed to them sheer
blasphemy, is praised for saying what was
right about God.</p>

<p>The theme of the Book of Job is one which
exercised the greatest of the Greek tragic
poets, and it is treated with an Æschylean
grandeur; in conception and execution it
declares the genius of its author. It has not
come into our hands altogether as it left his,
and certain parts of the poem are generally
recognized as additions by other pens.</p>

<p>The most considerable of these are the
speeches of Elihu (cc. 32-36). It has already
been noted that Elihu's name is not in the
prologue, he comes in with a bit of a prologue
of his own (xxxii. 1-5); and when the three
friends are rebuked in the epilogue, he, who
surely deserved the same condemnation, is
ignored. All his speeches, provocative
enough, draw no reply from Job. When, at
the end of Elihu's discourse, God answers out
of the whirlwind (xxxviii. 1 ff.), "Who is this
that darkeneth counsel by words without
knowledge," it is to Job he addresses himself,
not Elihu; and the appearance of God is
naturally taken as the response to Job's
challenge in xxxi. 35, "O that I had one to
hear me," etc., just before Elihu breaks in.
All these signs indicate that Elihu is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
intruder. This inference is borne out by the
arguments so pretentiously announced. They
are in the main variations on the themes in
the preceding speeches of the friends, with a
certain evident predilection for the idea that
suffering is a warning. It would seem that
another poet thought, as he makes Elihu
boast, that he could improve on the arguments
of the friends. The unbiassed reader, without
depreciating the poetical merit of the speeches,
will be likely to differ with him.</p>

<p>The eulogy of the divine wisdom (Job 28)
is a very fine poem, in the vein of Prov. 8, of
which it is probably not independent, but it
is, to say the least, inappropriate in the mouth
of Job at this point in the debate. The description
of ancient mining is particularly
noteworthy. In the speeches of God, the long
descriptions of the hippopotamus and the
crocodile (xl. 15-xli. 34) are not without reason
suspected of being purple patches, and in
putting them in some damage has been done
to the margins. It has been questioned
whether the prose prologue and epilogue really
belong with the poem; but it would not be
intelligible without them.</p>

<p>In Ezek. xiv. 14, 20 the name of Job occurs
with Noah and Daniel as exemplary righteous
men, who, if they were alive, could nevertheless
not save the wicked city of Jerusalem
from its doom; but whether the story
Ezekiel knew about Job had any resemblance
to the prologue of our book, no one can tell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
It may very well be that there was a prose
book of Job (in which, possibly, the friends
played the opposite rôle from that given them
in the poem), and that the poet took from it
the incidents and setting that he needed;
but about that also nothing can be known.</p>

<p>The age of the book is determined chiefly by
the problem with which it deals. The doctrine
of individual retribution is the application to
the individual of the prophetic teaching about
God's dealing with the nation; it appears in
a peculiarly crude and hard form in Ezekiel
at the moment of the break up of the nation.
It was furthered by the teaching of the sages,
as in Proverbs, about the connection between
prosperity and happiness and virtue. Experience
contradicted the dogma, and so the
problem of theodicy arose&mdash;arose in a peculiarly
difficult form, because all that befell a
man was attributed to the immediate act of
God, who was not relieved of any part of his
responsibility by talk of second causes and
natural laws, and because the sphere of
retribution was limited to this life, with no
relief in the possible compensations of another.</p>

<p>This is the problem of Job, and of itself
suffices to put the book in what is called
the post-exilic age. It belongs to the literature
of Jewish Wisdom, with Proverbs and
Ecclesiastes. The latter book, one of the
latest certainly in the Old Testament, is much
concerned with the same conflict of dogma with
experience, though in a very different spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Job may be a work of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>,
or perhaps of the fourth. The language would
incline us to the earlier date.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>ECCLESIASTES. SONG OF SONGS</h3>


<p>Two singular books remain, about the inspiration
of both of which the straitest sect of the
Pharisees in the first century of our era had
grave difficulties, Ecclesiastes and the Song
of Songs. Both are attributed to Solomon,
the Song by title, Ecclesiastes by implication
in the book itself, and doubtless the supposed
authorship had much to do with finally securing
the two books a place in the Jewish Bible.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes.</span>&mdash;The title of Ecclesiastes
runs, "The words of Koheleth the son of
David, king in Jerusalem," under which
pseudonym no one but Solomon can be meant;
see also Eccl. i. 12, and especially ii. 1-11.
In the body of the book, Koheleth is regularly
used as a proper name; it is apparently coined
for the nonce. Like many pseudonyms in
other literatures, it is probably a mystification,
piquant to the author's contemporaries
but impenetrable to us. That it means
"Preacher"&mdash;an ancient guess&mdash;is highly
improbable; but even if the meaning were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
transparent, there is no more reason for
translating a fictitious proper name than a
real one.</p>

<p>The theme of this symphony of pessimism
is stridently announced in the first notes of the
overture: "Vanity of vanities, vanity of
vanities! Everything is vanity." The world
and its happenings, man and his strivings,
pleasure, pain, wisdom, folly, good and evil&mdash;all
is utterly empty; existence has no meaning
and no worth. All is chance and change, in
which things endlessly go round and round,
but plan, purpose, progress is nowhere to be
seen. And as all have one lot, even this
senseless and inconstant fortune, so death
sooner or later overtakes all alike and ends
the strange play without plot we call human
life.</p>

<p>Of a divine providence directed to any end
or by any principle, of a justice above which
requites men according to their deeds, long
years and happiness to the wise and good,
adversity and premature death to the wicked
and foolish, Koheleth, looking on the world of
things as they are with searching eyes, discovers
no sign. Of another world and an
immortal soul, with which some of his
contemporaries consoled themselves, he, keeping
his thinking within the bounds of experience,
knows nothing. Man dies as the beast
dies, the same vital breath is in them both,
all are of dust and turn to dust again; nor
has man any advantage over the beast, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
all have the same end (iii. 19-21; ix. 4-6).
There is consolation in this thought, when
the misery of the world weighs too heavy on
the heart. The dead are better off than the
living, but happier still it would be never to be
born to see the evils that are under the sun
(iv. 2 f.).</p>

<p>When we look the facts squarely in the face,
the only counsel of wisdom is to make the most
of what capricious fortune gives us in its
friendly moods, to enjoy the pleasures life
offers while we can, with abandon, but without
excess. For the "too much" is always
evil, even too much wisdom and virtue!
"Be not over righteous nor put on too much
wisdom, why shouldest thou die before thy
time?" (vii. 16 f.).</p>

<p>The author's religion makes God somehow
the cause of what happens under the sun, the
evil and the good. In one place he seems to
express the belief that all that God does is
fine and opportune, if man could only understand
it; but God has denied man the
intelligence to penetrate the secret of his
ways. So there is nothing better for man to
do than to be merry, and have a good time
while he is alive!</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine what scandal all this
gave to pious souls, and it was very natural
that orthodox editors should try to neutralize
Koheleth's scepticism and his epicurean
counsels by notes in an opposite sense. A
modern editor would have put his protests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
into footnotes, as for example to Gibbon's
famous chapters on the spread of Christianity;
an ancient editor, having no footnotes, put
his incontinently into the text.</p>

<p>To these editorial improvements belong the
last verses (Eccl. xii. 13 f.), with its conclusion,
"Fear God and keep his commandments, for
this is the business of every man; for God
will bring every deed into the judgment on
all secrets, whether it be good or bad."
The judgment after death is evidently meant.
The warning against many books and much
reading in xii. 12 is also a gloss, while xii.
9-11 appears to be written by an earlier editor
of the book, commending it to reading and
study. In the body of the book, also, several
verses are obviously introduced to give an
orthodox twist to the author's very heterodox
utterances.</p>

<p>That Ecclesiastes belongs to the latest stratum
of Hebrew Biblical literature is evident
from both its matter and its style; but there
is nothing in it by which its age can be exactly
fixed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Song of Songs.</span>&mdash;A verse already quoted
(1 Kings iv. 32) tells that, besides three
thousand proverbs, Solomon composed a
thousand and five songs. We shall probably
not err in assuming that this verse was in the
mind of the editor who prefixed the title "The
Song of Songs (that is, the very best of songs),
by Solomon." There is nothing in the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to indicate that Solomon was the author or
that the poet meant his productions to be
attributed to him.</p>

<p>The one theme of the book, running through
many variations, is the love of man and
woman, passionate and sensuous. In the
second century of our era its songs were
warbled at banquets or wedding feasts, a profane
abuse on which a scandalized rabbi denounced
damnation. In the first century it was,
in spite of Solomon's name, no Holy Scripture
for the straitest sect, and was not finally
admitted to the canon, we may be pretty sure,
until an allegorical sense had been discovered
in it, or rather imposed on it: it sang, under
the figure of wedded love, of the relation of
the Lord to Israel. The Fathers took over all
the allegory, only making the lover Christ,
the beloved the Church (as still in the running
titles of the Authorized Version), or the
soul. The mediæval church saw in the bride
the Virgin Mary. The allegorical interpretation
was a necessary corollary of the dogmatic
assumption that the canon of inspired scripture
could contain nothing but books of religious
instruction and edification. Allegorical
love poetry&mdash;usually the love of God and the
soul&mdash;is not uncommon in mystical sects or
circles of various creeds; and the ultra-spiritual
poets often revel in an ultra-sensual
imagery of passion and fruition; but nothing
in the Song of Songs suggests such an origin,
nor have we knowledge of a Jewish mysticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of this erotic type in the centuries from which
it must come.</p>

<p>The literary criticism of the last century
chiefly spent itself in endeavours to discover
in the book a lyric drama with a moral
tendency, on some such theme as the triumph
of pure love over lust. Great ingenuity was
expended in dividing the text into regular acts
and scenes and assigning the speeches to the
leading actors and the chorus. In its simplest
form there were but two actors, the virtuous
village maiden and the harem-jaded Solomon;
a more plausible scheme gave the girl a rustic
lover, which added much to the piquancy of
the scenes with Solomon, and to the <i>dénouement</i>,
in which the king, foiled by the maiden's
constancy, confesses virtue triumphant, and
sends her back to her shepherd swain. More
recent supporters of the dramatic hypothesis
have modified this scheme in a way to remove
some of its plainest difficulties, but have complicated
it in proportion.</p>

<p>Other interpreters take the book for a
collection of love songs, or, more specifically,
of wedding songs, such as are sung to-day at
village weddings in Syria and Palestine. A
certain dramatic quality in the songs, and
their relation to successive stages of the
festivities, would give the appearance of a
progressive action which has been urged for
the dramatic theory. The Syrian peasant
to-day, in the region of Damascus, is for his
bride-week in song and salutation a king or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
prince; a sledge on the village threshing-floor
is his throne, and the bride is queen. Through
the week the royal pair are honoured by the
villagers with songs and dances. If in the
Hebrew songs the bridegroom-king is sometimes
called Solomon, it is because Solomon
was the richest and most splendid of kings.
This view of the nature of the book is simpler
and more probable. The several poems are
not distinguished by titles, and there is room
for difference of opinion about the divisions;
but this is a small difficulty compared with
the partition into roles in the supposed
play.</p>

<p>The songs are fine examples of popular
poetry, with traditional subjects, forms, and
imagery. Nothing requires us to suppose
that they are the production of one poet;
we may think of them rather as an anthology
of love songs, not necessarily all composed for
wedding festivities, but all appropriate for
use on such occasions.</p>

<p>The language of the songs proves that they
belong to a very late period in Hebrew
literature, though the type is doubtless old
enough. Such popular poetry has no motive
for preserving or imitating archaism, as hymn
writers do, but modernizes itself from generation
to generation. The wedding songs of old
Israel may have been like enough to these
in character, but they were in another
speech.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate misunderstanding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
has preserved them; but the accidental
preservation of these few pages emphasizes the
loss of almost every other vestige of Hebrew
secular poetry.</p>

in the first, which began with the ratification of Deuteronomy
in 621 <small>B.C.</small>, the Law (Pentateuch) was the only recognized
collection of Sacred Scripture; in the second the Law and the
Prophets; and in the third the Law, the Prophets, and the
"Writings." The latter part of the volume, which treats
of the history of the canon in the usual meaning of the term,
is a convenient but not very accurate compilation.</p>

<p>The article "Canon" (of the Old Testament) in the <i>Encyclopaedia
Biblica</i>, by Karl Budde, and the article "Old Testament
Canon" in Hastings' <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, by F. H.
Woods, are concise presentations of generally accepted
opinions by competent scholars.</p>

<p>3. <b>Literature of the Old Testament.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Driver, S. R.</span> <i>Introduction
to the Literature of the Old Testament.</i> 6th ed., revised,
1897. A volume of the <i>International Theological Library</i>,
designed primarily for ministers and students of theology.
The technical matter (lists of Hebrew words and the like) is,
however, set off from the body of the text, and the work can
therefore be used with profit by laymen for purposes of study.
The synopses of the contents of Biblical books will be found
helpful. The author is a scholar of conservative temper and
cautious about accepting new or radical theories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornill, Carl.</span> <i>Introduction to the Canonical Books
of the Old Testament.</i> Translated by G. H. Box. New York.
1907.&mdash;Originally one of a German series of theological
handbooks, this volume is on a smaller scale than Driver's
and goes less into details which are of interest only to the
professional student. The author's criticism is much less
conservative than Driver's and more original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span><span class="smcap">Kent, C. F.</span> <i>The Student's Old Testament.</i> 1904-1910.&mdash;I.
<i>Narratives of the Beginnings of Hebrew History</i>, 1904;
II. <i>Israel's Historical and Biographical Narratives</i>, 1905;
III. <i>The Sermons, Epistles, and Apocalypses of Israel's
Prophets</i>, 1910; IV. <i>Israel's Law and Legal Precedents</i>, 1907.
(Two volumes on the Poetical Books will complete the
series.) The sources of the Pentateuch and the Historical
Books are separated, and where the narratives are parallel
they are printed in parallel columns with headings indicating
their origin. The analysis is also set out in tabular form,
and maps and chronological charts are added. The oracles
of the prophets are arranged, so far as possible, in chronological
order, additions and interpolations being set in smaller
type. The author is an experienced teacher and book-maker,
and has a fine talent for exposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpenter, J. Estlin</span>, and <span class="smcap">Harford-Battersby, G.</span>
<i>The Hexateuch according to the Revised Version.</i> 2 vols.
1900.&mdash;The first volume (separately reprinted, 1902) contains
an excellent history of criticism, and develops fully and very
clearly the evidence for the prevailing theory concerning the
sources and composition of the Hexateuch. Tabular appendices
exhibit the linguistic evidence in a form which makes
it available, as far as possible, to the reader who does not know
Hebrew; they also give a synopsis of the laws and institutions,
and an analysis and conspectus of the several codes.
The second volume presents in the text of the Revised Version
the analysis of the Pentateuch and Joshua in an extremely
ingenious typographical scheme.</p>

<p>The articles on the Books of the Old Testament, from
Genesis to Judges inclusive, in the <i>Encyclopaedia Biblica</i>,
by the author of the present volume, may be referred to for a
fuller statement of the reasons for his views and a more
detailed analysis. The article "Historical Literature" in the
same Encyclopaedia gives a comprehensive survey of the
Hebrew historiography from its beginnings down to the time
of Josephus. The article on "Prophecy and Prophets"
in Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible, by A. B. Davidson,
though not dealing primarily with critical questions, may be
strongly commended, and the article on "Psalms," by W. T.
Davison, in the same volume, is good. An excellent article
on "Proverbs" in the <i>Encyclopaedia Biblica</i> should also be
mentioned.</p>
